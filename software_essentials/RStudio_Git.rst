**RStudio with Version Control**
================================

RStudio can be used with Git or SVN. For today's lesson we're going to be using Git with your new GitHub accounts. 

.. #### Comment: short description

**Some things to remember about the platform**

- You can pull other GitHub repositories using ``git clone`` via the RStudio terminal.
- Your local commits are not sent to GitHub until you initiate the repository with your GitHub username and password.  

----

*Instructions*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Create a GitHub Repository
  
  2. On your local computer, create a directory called ``~/github`` and change into that directory
  
  3. Open RStudio and start a new Project: *File > New Project > Version Control > Git*. In the ``repository URL`` paste the URL of your new GitHub repository
 
  4. Save your new git repository to the newly created ``~/github`` directory.
  
  5. Open the directory in RStudio and set the project folder as the workspace.

*R Markdown*
~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Create a new `.Rmd` format file.
  
  2. Set the parameters (e.g. HTML, PDF, etc)
  
  3. Create an code block and specify the language, e.g.
  
.. code:: R 
  ```{R, echo=FALSE}
  
  ```
  ```{bash, echo=FALSE}
  
  ```
  ```{python, echo=FALSE}
  
  ```
  4. Run the code block

*Workflow R*
~~~~~~~~~~~

R has `many projects which deal with workflows <https://github.com/jdblischak/r-project-workflows>`_

We're going to talk about the ``workflowr`` and ``drake``

1. Install Packages and depends
  
.. code::
   install.package(c("workflowr","drake"), dependencies=TRUE)
      
2. Follow instructions for building a  `workflowr website <https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-01-getting-started.html>`_ 
  
3. Follow instructions for building a  `drake <https://ropensci.github.io/drake/>`_ workflow
  

*Self Paced*
------------

`rOpenSci <https://github.com/ropensci>`_ is a leader in the development of reproducible research. There are hundreds of repositories to explore for examples of research using R.
