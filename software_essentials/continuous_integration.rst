**Continuous Integration**
======================

`Continous Integration (CI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`_ is a practice of checking code repositories (typically a few times a day) to test for changes which may cause failures.

CI can be integrated into either scientific programming workflows or into code development

The most popular CI tools are:

  - `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`_ - fast, easy to set up, cloud based
  - `Circle CI <https://circleci.com/>`_ - fast, easy to set up, cloud based
  - `Jenkins <https://jenkins.io/>`_ - free, can be hosted internally (requires server), highly customizable (plugins)

**When to use CI?**

 * building or hosting services to a community
 * developing versioned copies of containers for public consumption
 * DevOps + Data Science 
 
**Travis CI**
~~~~~~~~~~

`Setup <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/>`_

**Circle CI**
~~~~~~~~~~

`Setup <https://circleci.com/docs/enterprise/quick-start/>`_

**Jenkins**
~~~~~~~~~~

Jenkins is a bit harder to set up because you need a dedicated server

`Setup <https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/>`_


**Badges**
~~~~~~~~~

Status badges can be embedded in a README.md. Badges let you show the state of code or documentation.

You can view a diverse list of different badges on `Shields.io <https://shields.io/>`_

*Different Badge Styles*
---------

Now you can pass the ``style`` GET argument,
to get custom styled badges same as you would for shields.io. 
If no argument is passed, ``flat`` is used as default.
