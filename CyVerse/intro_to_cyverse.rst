**About CyVerse**
=================

**CyVerse Vision:** Transforming science through data-driven discovery.

**CyVerse Mission:** Design, deploy, and expand a national
cyberinfrastructure for life sciences research and train scientists in
its use.

CyVerse provides life scientists with powerful computational
infrastructure to handle huge datasets and complex analyses, thus
enabling data-driven discovery. Our powerful extensible platforms
provide data storage, bioinformatics tools, image analyses, cloud
services, APIs, and more.

Originally created as the iPlant Collaborative to serve
U.S. plant science communities, the cyberinfrastructure we have built is germane
to all life sciences disciplines and works equally well on data from
plants, animals, or microbes. Thus, iPlant was renamed CyVerse to reflect the broader community now served by our infrastructure. By democratizing access to supercomputing
capabilities, we provide a crucial resource to enable scientists to find
solutions for the future. CyVerse is of, by, and for the community, and community-driven needs
shape our mission. We rely on your feedback to provide the
infrastructure you need most to advance your science, development, and
educational agenda.

**Evolution of CyVerse**


|evolcyverse|


CyVerse is an NSF-funded project. The project began in 2008 as 'iPlant' with the mission of 'empowering a new plant biology'. Funding was renewed in 2013 for another 5 years with the new mission of 'cyberinfrastructure for life sciences'. In 2016 the name of the project was changed from 'iPlant' to 'CyVerse' to reflect its role in all life scieneces, not just plants. In 2018 CyVerse was renewed for another 5 years with our current mission: 'to design, deploy, and expand a national Cyberinfrastructure for Life Sciences research, and to train scientists in its use'.

Over the past 10 years CyVerse priorities have focused on genomics and transcriptomics tools that were needed to deal with the huge increase in high-throughput seqeuncing data. While that is still a priority, CyVerse has since expanded to include image and geospatial analysis tools. CyVerse is built for data.

What is Cyberinfrastructure?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cyberinfrastructure is a combination of
    - platforms, tools and datasets researchers need to do their work
    - storage and compute hardware necessary for modern analyses
    - people who provide training and support

The CyVerse cyberinfrastructure can be thought of in layers. The bottom layer (on which everything else is built) consists of the hardware resources. On top of that are the services necessary to make a functional system. The next layer represents extensible services, or those parts of the system that may be adopted and used by thrid parties. Most users will interact primarily with the top layer which represents the various analysis and distribution platforms. While the bottom layers are the most flexible, the top layers are the most user-friendly.
