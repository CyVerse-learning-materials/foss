**Atmosphere**
==============
CyVerse operates a cloud service called `Atmosphere <http://www.cyverse.org/atmosphere>`_. Users can request up to 5,000 allocation units [units are hours (hr)] per month. E.g. a 1-core instance uses 1 AU/hr, a 4-core instance uses 4 AU/hr, and a 16-core instance uses 16 AU/hr. Allocations are automatically reset to 128 AU on the 1st of each month. 

.. #### Comment: short description

*Some things to remember about the platform*

- Allocation Units can be requested each month, but expire at the end of the month. Users can request more AU by clicking the Request More Resources button in the Atmosphere UI. You can also get help by asking questions in the Intercom (blue button in the lower right of the CyVerse website pages). 

- Don't leave VMs running that aren't being used (be a good data science neighbor and free resources for others).

*Login*
~~~~~~~

Log into `CyVerse Atmosphere <http://atmo.cyverse.org/>`_

`Atmosphere Manual <https://cyverse.github.io/atmosphere-guides/>`_

Alternately, log into `XSEDE Jetstream <https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/application>`_

Fill in your ``username`` and ``password`` and click "LOGIN"
           
*Create a Project*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is something you only need to do once.

- Click on the "Projects" tab on the top and then click "CREATE NEW PROJECT"

- Enter a name, e.g. "FOSS2019" into the Project Name field.

- the Description can be something complex and long (like an extended abstract, or tutorial), or something short like "CyVerse FOSS 2019".

- Select the newly created project

*Start a new Instance*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From your Project folder, you can select "New" and "Instance"

1. Suggest you select a featured image with a Graphic User Interface (GUI). 

**Suggested Atmosphere Image(s):**

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

**Atmosphere Image(s):**

Here are the tested Ubuntu images. 

**Warning:** The latest version of Ubuntu (18.04) may not have current packages for some software.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Image Name
      - Version
      - Description
      - Link
    * - Ubuntu 18.04 GUI
      - 1.0
      - Ubuntu 18.04 GUI XFCE Base
      -	`Image <https://atmo.cyverse.org/application/images/1556>`_
    * - Ubuntu 18.04 non-GUI
      - 1.0
      - Ubuntu 18.04 non-GUI Base
      -	`Image <https://atmo.cyverse.org/application/images/1552>`_ 

- Find the "Ubuntu 18.04" image, click on it

- Give it a short name that is distinct "my_first_vm" 

- Select 'tiny1 (CPU: 1, Mem: 4GB, Disk: 30GB)'. Because this is your first attempt at provisioning a virtual machine it doesn't need to be a workhorse (yet). 

- Leave rest of the fields as default.

- Wait for it to become active

- Be Patient (but not too patient - if it takes >10 minutes the system may be at capacity, if you're trying to launch a large or extra large VM, try something smaller).

- You can click on your new instance to get more information.

*Accessing the Shell*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the instance is `active`, you can access it via ``ssh`` or by using the Web Shell provided by Atmosphere. 

- Click "Open Web Shell", *or*, if you know how to use ssh,
you can ssh in with your CyVerse username on the IP address of the machine 

.. code-block:: bash

	ssh CyVerseUserName@<INSTANCE-IP-ADDRESS>

You should see something like this

.. code-block :: bash

	Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-81-generic x86_64)

	  Get cloud support with Ubuntu Advantage Cloud Guest:
	    http://www.ubuntu.com/business/services/cloud

	155 packages can be updated.
	0 updates are security updates.


	*** System restart required ***
	Welcome to
	    _   _                             _
	   / \ | |_ _ __ ___   ___  ___ _ __ | |__   ___ _ __ ___
	  / _ \| __| '_ ` _ \ / _ \/ __| '_ \| '_ \ / _ \ '__/ _ \

	/_/   \_\__|_| |_| |_|\___/|___/ .__/|_| |_|\___|_|  \___|
	
	cyverse_username@vm142-39:~$

Note, this instance is running an older version of Ubuntu 18.

A good practice before installing any new software is to run:

.. code-block :: bash

	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

After the new updates are installed you can reboot the machine from terminal or from the Atmosphere UI

.. code-block :: bash

	sudo reboot

If you're using the Web Shell, the instance will exit. Wait a few minutes for the instance to reboot and refresh the screen.
	
.. Note:: 

	To access the Clipboard in an Apache Guacamole Web Shell:

	- Open Clipboard and virtual keyboard
	  - On a standard keyboard: `ctrl` + `alt` + `shift` key
	  - On a MAC OS X keyboard: `control` + `command ⌘` + `shift` key

	- Select your text or paste text into the clipboard window.

	- Close the Clipboard window by selecting `control` + `command ⌘` + `shift` keys again

	- Right click with your mouse or double tap fingers on touchpad to paste in the web shell or Desktop

**Suspending an instance**

- When you're done using an instance it is wise to 'Suspend' the instance in the Actions. 

- This will kill any process that is still running.

- Your data and all of your programs will be fine. It is however wise to move your data back onto your DataStore or back it up somewhere else so it will be available.

- Suspending the instance will leave it ready for reuse when you want to "resume" working on it.

- You will not be charged any AU while the instance is suspended. 

**Deleting your instance**

- To completely remove your instance, you can select the "delete" buttom from the instance details page. 

- This will open up a dialogue window. Select the "Yes, delete this instance" button.

- It may take Atmosphere a few minutes to process your request. The instance should disappear from the project when it has been successfully deleted. 

**Imaging an instance**

The use of Docker and Singularity take a lot of the problems out of building unique software stacks on cloud - but sometimes these cannot be avoided. 

- Have you created a unique software stack that you need to launch on a larger number of future instances? 

- Does it take a long time to compile your software stack each time you launch a new instance?

- Only create images from the smallest possible versions of your instance. A larger imaged instance cannot be run on a smaller instance.

To request that your instance be imaged click the "Image" button from Actions.

.. Note::

  It is advisable to delete the machine if you are not planning to use it in future to save valuable resources. However if you want to use it in future, you can suspend it.
  
  If you want to keep the instance for a future project, you can also "shelve" the instance. It will take a longer period of time to resume a shelved instance.
  
  
*EZ Installation of Project Jupyter*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We install Project Jupyter (Notebooks and Lab) using the `Anaconda distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_. Within the Anaconda distribution is the ``conda`` package manager which can be used to both build and install software. 

Anaconda is different than a basic Python installation. It serves as both a package manager and an environment. While this has many benefits, it also adds some complexity to running your Python environments. Still confused? Read about the `myths and misconceptions of Anaconda <http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/>`_.

For more details about installing software on Atmosphere visit the CyVerse `Data Science Quickstart Tutorial <https://cyverse-ez-quickstart.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`_ or the `Jetstream EZ Tutorial <https://iujetstream.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JWT/pages/348586006/Jetstream+Atmosphere+EZ+tools>`_. There are instructions for ``ez`` installation of Docker, Singularity, and Anaconda.

If you're on an instance which already has Anaconda installed, you'll still need to re-run ``ez`` to restart the Anaconda virtual environment. 

1. Install Anaconda with Python3 (``ez`` comes preloaded on featured instances on Atmosphere and Jetstream) by typing:

	.. code-block :: bash

		ezj

2. Once the installation completes, you're done! A Jupyter Notebook should now be running on the VM.

|notebook_terminal|

3. Click the link showing the notebook URL (notice this is not the localhost:8888). 

.. Note::

	To install your own packages you'll need to change ownership of the Anaconda installation:

		.. code-block :: bash

			sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) /opt/anaconda3 -R
        
	**Down version Python 3.6 to 3.5**
	
	To use GDAL you may need to reverse version Python to an earlier version

*Installing RStudio-Server*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RStudio can be installed in several ways. 

First, you can follow the RStudio-Server `instructions for Linux <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/>`_

Second, you can use Docker (following the same ``ez`` `documentation <https://cyverse-ez-quickstart.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html>`_ as for Anaconda). We suggest using containers from Docker Hub `Rocker <https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/geospatial/>`_ on the instance.

	.. code-block :: bash
	
		ezd
		sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
		exit
		docker pull rocker/geospatial
		docker run -d -p 8787:8787 rocker/geospatial

Third, you can use `Anaconda <https://cyverse-ez-quickstart.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/rstudio.html>`_ 

Here we use ``ezj`` to install both Anaconda (Jupyter) and R

	.. code-block :: bash
		
		ezj -R

This will trigger the Ansible playbook to install ``r-base``, ``r-essentials``, and a few other commonly used R Data Science packages.

After ``ezj -R`` has finished, you can install RStudio-Server

Install these misc. dependencies

	.. code-block :: bash
		
		export PATH="/opt/anaconda3/bin":$PATH
		sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) /opt/anaconda3/ -R	
		conda update conda
		conda install gxx_linux-64
		conda install gcc_linux-64

Set Path and install ``gdebi``

	.. code-block :: bash
	
		sudo apt-get install gdebi-core

Install RStudio-Server with ``gdebi``:

	.. code-block :: bash
	
		echo "export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R='/opt/anaconda3/bin/R'" >> ~/.bash_profile
		wget https://download2.rstudio.org/rstudio-server-1.1.447-amd64.deb
		sudo gdebi --non-interactive rstudio-server-1.1.447-amd64.deb

The installation of RStudio-Server is going to fail because we haven't told it which R to use. Because we are using Anaconda's installation of R, and not the basic installation of R, we have to reassign RStudio to look for Anaconda

	.. code-block :: bash
	
		sudo sh -c 'echo "rsession-which-r=/opt/anaconda3/bin/R" >> /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf'
		# export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R='/opt/anaconda/lib/R/bin/R'
		# sudo sh -c 'echo "launchctl setenv RSTUDIO_WHICH_R $RSTUDIO_WHICH_R" >> ~/.bash_profile'

Restart the server

	.. code-block :: bash
	
		sudo rstudio-server start

4. You can launch Jupyter Lab by exiting the notebook and typing `jupyter lab` - but this will allow Lab to only be available on the localhost, with no way to connect from a remote terminal. Exit the notebook by pressing `ctrl + c` twice, and then start a `Jupyter Lab <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab>`_.

**Hands On**
-------

`Sateesh's Atmosphere Exercises <https://snakemake2019.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Atmosphere_Cloud.html>`_

.. Note::

	To ensure your session doesn't die when you close your terminal use `tmux` or `screen` to start your remote sessions and to detach the screen before exiting.

	- detach screen: `ctrl + b` then `d`

	- list tmux sessions: ``tmux ls``

	- re-attach screen: ``tmux attach -t <session id #>``

*Establishing a Secure Connection*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. On the VM start the Lab in terminal (don't forget to use `tmux`)

	.. code-block :: bash	
	
		jupyter lab --no-browser --ip=* --port=8888


**Option 1: SSH tunnel**

You must have the ability to use ``ssh`` on your localhost to use this method.

1. Start Jupyter

	.. code-block :: bash	
	
		jupyter lab --no-browser --ip=127.0.0.1 --port=8888

2. Open a new terminal on your localhost. 

	.. code-block :: bash
	
		ssh -nNT -L 8888:localhost:8888 CyVerseUserName@<IPADDRESS>

	Enter your password when prompted. 
	
	The terminal should stop responding after this.

3. In your browser, open a new tab and go to ``http://localhost:8888``

**Option 2: Caddy**

You can use this method with ``tmux`` in the Web Shell

1. Follow the same step #1 above

2. In the terminal start a new ``tmux`` session. Then copy/paste the following:

	.. code-block :: bash
	
		echo "$(hostname)
		proxy / 127.0.0.1:8888 {
		    websocket
		    transparent
		}
		" > Caddyfile
		curl https://getcaddy.com | bash -s personal http.nobots
		caddy

	The `Caddyserver <https://caddyserver.com/>`_ will output a secure URL `https://` for the Atmosphere VM which you can then connect in a new browser tab.

3. Copy / Paste the URL ``https://vm142-xx.cyverse.org`` into a new browser tab.

..
