# The Unix Shell, Git and Github: an Introduction

### Requirements

Command Line Interfaces (CLI) are found throughout all Operating Systems, however we recommend the use of the Unix CLI. If you have a Unix based machine such as Linux/Ubuntu (or other Linux distributions), macOS, you are ready for the next step. If you use a Windows machine, please install the [Windows Subsistem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) as seen in the [Before FOSS Starts](installation.md#Software) section.

## The Unix Shell

The computer is a tool. It evolved over the years from being an intricated calculator into an interactive machine with thousands of moving parts that keep us all connected through the Internet. It is now the norm to use a mouse, keyboard, and seeing flashing images on our screens through the Graphical User Interface (GUI). GUIs are central to the way we interact with computers, however, to best take advantage of the computer's many systems, one needs to learn of the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**. The CLI sees the computer stripped down to only a [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) from where one can run powerful commands executed through the [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)).

Whilst the GUI allows for *better accessbility* to a computer, the CLI allows for *advanced usage* of one's computer. 

### CLI vs Terminal vs Shell

- [CLI (Command Line Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface): an interface that receives commands (and gives output) from a user in the form of lines of text.
- [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator): **the** text based interface window.
- [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)): a computer program and scripting language that presents a CLI which allows you to control your computer using commands.

The **Shell** sends commands to the computer through the **CLI** accessible through a **Terminal** window
