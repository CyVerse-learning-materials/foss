# The Unix Shell, Git and Github: an Introduction

### Requirements

Command Line Interfaces (CLI) are found throughout all Operating Systems, however we recommend the use of the Unix CLI. If you have a Unix based machine such as Linux/Ubuntu (or other Linux distributions), macOS, you are ready for the next step. If you use a Windows machine, please install the [Windows Subsistem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) as seen in the [Before FOSS Starts](installation.md#Software) section.

## The Unix Shell

The computer is a tool. It evolved over the years from being an intricated calculator into an interactive machine with thousands of moving parts that keep us all connected through the Internet. It is now the norm to use a mouse, keyboard, and seeing flashing images on our screens through the Graphical User Interface (GUI). GUIs are central to the way we interact with computers, however, to best take advantage of the computer's many systems, one needs to learn of the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**. The CLI sees the computer stripped down to only a [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) from where one can run powerful commands executed through the [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)).

Whilst the GUI allows for *better accessbility* to a computer, the CLI allows for *advanced usage* of one's computer. 

### CLI vs Terminal vs Shell

- [CLI (Command Line Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface): an interface that receives commands (and gives output) from a user in the form of lines of text.
- [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator): **the** text based interface window.
- [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)): a computer program and scripting language that presents a CLI which allows you to control your computer using commands.

The **Shell** sends commands to the computer through the **CLI** accessible through a **Terminal** window

### Things-to-Know About Commands

- Shell commands are used to **navigate**, **visualize**, **modify** (files/folders) and **automate** (processes), and can only be executed through the shell's terminal window.
- For every command, typing `man` (manual) before the command, will open the manual for said command.
```
$ man ls
```
    - Doing the above command will result in opening the *manual* for the `ls` command. You can exist the man page by pressing `q`.
- Each command has **flags**, or options, which are summoned with a `-`, such as `<command> -<flag>`.
```
$ ls -a -l -h
```
    - Doing the above command calls for the `-a` (all), `-l` (long), `-h` (human readable) flags. This causes `ls` to output a list of *all* files (inculding hidden files/folders) with human readable file size (e.g., it will list 3MB instead of 3000000), permissions, creator, and date of creation.
    - If you do not know what flags are available, you can refer to the `man` command (or for many tools, use the `-h` (help) flag).
- `.` refers to *current* directory; `..` refers to *above* directory; `/` is the directory separator; `~` indicates the home directory.
```
$ ls .            # lists files and folders in the current directory
$ ls ..           # lists files and folders in the above directory
$ ls ~            # lists files and folders in the home directory
$ ls ~/Documents  # lists files and folders in Documents (a folder present in the home directory)
```

### Introductory Shell Commands

!!! info "A short tutorial introducing the Shell"
        Here below are quick explanations of a few elementary commands that will help you orient and navigate your files and folders through the Shell. If you would like to follow along the explanations for each command, feel free to download and unzip the [shell-lesson-data.zip](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip) file from the [Shell's Carpentry module](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html).
        
        ??? question "Don't have access to a GUI?"
            Following along on a machine with no access to a GUI? Execute the following commands:
            ```
            $ sudo apt install unzip
            $ wget https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip
            $ unzip shell-lesson-data.zip
            ``` 

#### Navigation

| Command | Explanation |
|---|---|
|`pwd`| print working directory |
|`ls`| list content of folder |
|`cd`| change directory |

By typing `pwd`, the current working directory is printed.

```
$ pwd
/mnt/d/
```

We can then use `ls` to see the contents of the current directory. By using the `-F` flag (`ls -F`) we can also see the type of file. **Note:** an asterisk (`*`) at the end of the object will denote a file, whilst a slash (`/`) will denote a folder.

```
$ ls -F 
shell-lesson-data/   shell-lesson-data.zip*
```

We can then move inside the folder of our choice doing `cd`. Doing `ls` following the opening of the folder of choice, will show the contents of the folder you just moved in. Feel free to explore the contents of the folders by using `cd` and `ls`.

```
$ cd shell-lesson-data
$ ls -F

exercise-data/  north-pacific-gyre/

$ ls -F exercise-data/

animal-counts/  creatures/  numbers.txt*  proteins/  writing/
```

!!! Tip "Use the Tab key to autocomplete"
        You do not need to type the entire name of a folder or file. By using the tab key, the Shell will autocomplete the name of the files or folders. For example, typing the following

        ```
        $ ls -F exer
        ```

        and pressing the tab key, will result in autocompletion.

        ```
        $ ls -F exercise-data/
        ```

        You can then press tab twice, to print a list of the contents of the folder.

        ```
        $ ls -F exercise-data/
        animal-counts/ creatures/     numbers.txt    proteins/      writing/ 
        ```

#### Working with Files and Directories

| Command | Explanation |
|---|---|
|`mkdir`| make a directory |
|`touch`| creat empty file |
|`nano` or `vim`| text editors |
|`mv`| move command |
|`cp`| copy command | 
|`rm`| remove command |


Return to `shell-lesson-data`, and crate a directory with `mkdir <name of folder>`.

```
$ mkdir my_folder
$ ls -F
exercise-data/  my_folder/  north-pacific-gyre/
```

Notice the new `my_folder` directory.

!!! danger "Naming your files"
        It is strongly suggested that you avoid using spaces when naming your files. When using the Shell to communicate with your machine, a space can cause errors when loading or transferring files. Instead, use dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`) and CamelCase when naming your files.
        
        Acceptable naming:
        ```
        $ mkdir my_personal_folder
        $ mkdir my_personal-folder
        $ mkdir MyPersonal.Folder
        ```
        ??? Question
            What do you think will happen if you attempt creating a folder by typing spaces?
            
            ??? Success "Solution"
                You will obtain as many folders as typed words!
                ```
                $ mkdir my folder
                $ ls -F
                exercise-data/  folder/  my/  north-pacific-gyre/
                ```
                Notice the two folders `my` and `folder`.

Create an empty file with `touch <name of file>`.

```
$ touch new_file
```

`touch` will create an **empty** file, it is up to you to populate using whichever text editor you prefer. Refer to the carpentries material to know more about nano and its functionalities ([link](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html#create-a-text-file)).

!!! tip
        You can also use your text editor to look at the contents of your files!

Use `mv <name of file or folder you want to move> <name of destination folder>` to move your newly created file to the directory you created previously (you can then use `ls` to check if you successully moved the file).

```
$ ls -F
exercise-data/  new_file*  my_folder/  north-pacific-gyre/

$ mv new_file my_folder/
$ ls -F
exercise-data/  my_folder/  north-pacific-gyre/

$ ls -F my_folder/
new_file*
```
`mv` can also be used to **rename** a file or folder with  `mv <name of file or folder you want to change> <new name>`.

```
$ cd my_folder/
$ mv new_file my_file
$ ls -F
my_file*
```

`cp` is the command to copy a file with the syntax `cp <name of file you want to copy> <name of copy file>`

```
$ cp my_file copy_my_file
$ ls -F 
copy_my_file*  my_file*
```

!!! note "Copying folders"
        To copy folders and the content of these folders, you will have to use the `-r` flag (recursive) for `cp` in the following manner `cp -r <name of folder you want to copy> <name of copy folder>` (following example is from the `shell-lesson-data/` directory).
        ```
        $ cp -r my_folder/ copy_my_folder
        $ ls -F
        copy_my_folder/  exercise-data/  my_folder/  north-pacific-gyre/
        
        $ ls -F my_folder/
        copy_my_file*  my_file*

        $ ls -F copy_my_folder/
        copy_my_file*  my_file*
        ```

To remove an unwanted file, use `rm <name of file to remove>`.

```
$ rm copy_my_file
$ ls -F 
my_file
```

!!! note "Removing folders"
        Save as the "Copying Folders" note, you have to use the `-r` flag to remove a folder `rm -r <name of folder you want to remove>` (following example is from the `shell-lesson-data/` directory).
        ```
        $ rm -r copy_my_folder/
        $ ls -F
        exercise-data/  my_folder/  north-pacific-gyre/
        ```
