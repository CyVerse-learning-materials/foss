# Documentation and Communication

Manuscripts and conference presentations are one of the primary ways of
communicating our research, but they are far from the only avenues of
communcation. Particularly as our methods become more complicated and
customized, open science means giving people a better understanding of
our approaches and tools than may be required in most journals.

Communicating with growing teams of researchers that may span
institutions, time zones, or continents also requires more modern
approaches. Strong frameworks for internal communication and
documentation can make collaboration easier, improve the quality of your
science, and reduce the hassle of collaborative work.

# Documentation

This website is rendered using a
[ReadTheDocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/) template. Think of RTD as
\"Continuous Documentation\".

ReadTheDocs has become a popular tool for developing web-based
documentation. [CyVerse Learning Materials
Github](https://github.com/CyVerse-learning-materials) hosts a few
templates which you can view and pull for your own use.

[Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) is an open-source R package that
facilitates writing books and long-form articles/reports with R
Markdown.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or
[Bootstrap.js](https://getbootstrap.com/), are another popular way of
hosting websites via GitHub.

[Confluence Wikis (CyVerse)](https://wiki.cyverse.org) are another tool
for documenting your workflow.

*Some things to remember* \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

# *Open Science Framework*

-   Provides tools via [osf.io](https://osf.io/) for free
-   Can be directly linked to your ORCID
-   Integrated project management tools
-   Uses templates to create a project website
-   Can publish preprints from within project management tools

*ReadTheDocs* \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

-   publishing websites via
    [ReadTheDocs.com](https://readthedocs.com/dashboard/) costs money.
-   You can work in an offline state, where you develop the materials
    and publish them to your localhost using
    [Sphinx](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html)
-   You can work on a website template in a GitHub repository, and
    pushes are updated in near real time using ReadTheDocs.com.

*Bookdown* \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

-   Bookdown websites can be hosted by [RStudio
    Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/)
-   You can publish a Bookdown website using [Github
    Pages](https://github.blog/2016-08-17-simpler-github-pages-publishing/)

*GitHub Pages* \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

-   You can pull templates from other GitHub users for your website,
    e.g. [jekyll themes](http://themes.jekyllrc.org/)
-   GitHub pages are free, fast, and easy to build, but limited in use
    of subdomain or URLs.

## **Websites to Host Methods & Protocols**

[Protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/) - collaborative platform and
preprint server for: science methods, computational workflows, clinical
trials, operational procedures, safety checklists, and instructions /
manuals.

[QUBES](https://qubeshub.org/) - community of math and biology educators
who share resources and methods for preparing students to tackle real,
complex, biological problems.

# Communication

### Internal

Choosing which software to use for your internal lab communication can
be complicated by the cost of setting up, the cost of maintaining, and
simply by the sheer number of platforms that are out there.

For this workshop, we use [SLACK](https://slack.com/) (Searchable Log of
All Conversation & Knowledge). Microsoft\'s competitor to SLACK is
[Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/start).

Remember, the intention of these platforms are to **improve
productivity** & not become a distraction.

::: remember
**SLACK**

-   Slack has [plenty of apps](https://slack.com/apps) for coordinating
    multiple services, i.e. Calendars, Github, GoogleDrive, Box, etc.
-   Slack is limiting unless you\'re willing to pay for the professional
    support.

**Microsoft Teams**

-   Teams is used by many R1 research universities as part of their
    campus wide license agreement for Office 365 Business and Education.

### External

Although we didn\'t cover it explicitly in the announcement for the
workshop, communicating with the public and other members of your
science community is one of the most important parts of your science!

There are many ways scientists use social media and the web to share
their data science ideas:

1.  [\"Science
    Twitter\"](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/08/scientists-do-you-want-succeed-twitter-here-s-how-many-followers-you-need) -
    is really just regular
    [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/science?lang=en), but with a
    focus on following other scientists and organizations, and tweeting
    about research you\'re interested in. By building up a significant
    following, more people will know you, know about your work, and
    you\'ll have a higher likelihood of meeting other new collaborators.
2.  [Blogs](https://blogging.org/blog/top-science-blogs/) - there are
    numerous platforms for blogging about research, the older platforms
    tend to dominate this space. Other platforms like,
    [Medium](https://medium.com/topic/data-science) offer a place for
    reseachers to create personalized reading spaces and self publish.
3.  Community groups - There are lists (and lists of lists) of
    [nationals research
    organizations](https://www.google.com/search?q=list+of+professional+science+organizations),
    in which a researcher can become involved. These older organziations
    still rely on official websites, science journal blogs, and email
    lists to communicate with their members. In the earth sciences there
    are open groups which focus on communication like the [Earth Science
    Information Partners (ESIP)](https://www.esipfed.org/) with
    progressive ideas about how data and science can be done. Other
    groups, like [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and
    [Research Bazaar](https://resbazblog.wordpress.com/about/) are
    focused on data science training and digital literacy.

**Remember** Personal and Professional Accounts are Not Isolated

You decide what you post on the internet. Your scientist identity may be
a part of your personal identity on social media, it might be separate.
A future employer or current employer can see your old posts. What you
post in your personal accounts can be considered a reflection of the
organization you work for and may be used in decisions about hiring or
dismissal.
