### Get off your own machine

More and more work is being done somewhere other than a personal computer. This could be an HPC cluster at a university or a cloud computing provider. "Cloud" just means somebody else is handling the computers, and you get to use them when you need to, typically for a price. Some 'cloud' options include: Binder, Colab, and Cyverse VICE and Github Codespace. 

The take home message on Cloud is that it is a great way to make your work more reproducible, as you can share a link to your work, and anyone can run it without having to install anything.
