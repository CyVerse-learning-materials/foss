# Reproducibility II: Containers

!!! Success "Learning Objectives"

    After this lesson, you should be able to:

    * Explain what containers are used for in reproducible research contexts
    * Search for and run a Docker container locally or on a remote system
    * Understand how version control and data can be used inside a container


## What *are* containers?

A [container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/){target=_blank} is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Container images are a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Containers are similar to virtual machines (VMs), but are smaller and easier to share. A big distinction between Containers and VMs is what is within each environment: VMs require the OS to be present within the image, whilst containers rely on the host OS and the container engine (e.g., Docker Engine).

* The most common container software is [:material-docker: Docker](https://www.docker.com/){target=_blank}, which is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers. [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/) (formerly, Singularity), is another popular container engine, which allows you to deploy containers on HPC clusters.

* [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) is the world's largest respository of container images. Think of it as the 'Github' of container images. It facilitates collaboration amongst developers and allows you to share your container images with the world. Dockerhub allows users to maintain different versions of container images.

!!! Warning
    
    While Docker allows you to quickly run software from other people, it may not work across every platform. There are different CPU architectures (`arm`, `amd64`, `x64, `x86`) deployed across cloud, computer workstations, laptops, and cellular phones. Docker containers and their software can be cross-compiled across architectures, but this must be done by the creators.


## Containers for Reproducible Science
Software containers, such as those managed by Docker or Singularity, are incredibly useful for reproducible science for several reasons:

#### Environment Consistency: 
Containers encapsulate the software environment, ensuring that the same versions of software, libraries, and dependencies are used every time, reducing the "it works on my machine" problem.

#### Ease of Sharing:

Containers can be easily shared with other researchers, allowing them to replicate the exact software environment used in a study.

#### Platform Independence:

Containers can run on different operating systems and cloud platforms, allowing for consistency across different hardware and infrastructure.

#### Version Control:

Containers can be versioned, making it easy to keep track of changes in the software environment over time.
#### Scalability:

Containers can be easily scaled and deployed on cloud infrastructure, allowing for reproducible science at scale.
#### Isolation:

Containers isolate the software environment from the host system, reducing the risk of conflicts with other software and ensuring a clean and controlled environment.

## Introduction to :material-docker: Docker 

<figure markdown>
  <a href="https://hub.docker.com" target="blank" rel="docker">![gitlfs](https://cc.cyverse.org/assets/docker/docker.png) </a>
</figure>

#### Prerequisites

In order to complete these exercises we **STRONGLY** recommend that you set up a personal [:material-github: GitHub](https://github.com){target=_blank} and [:material-docker: DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com){target=_blank} account (account creation for both services is free). 

There are no specific skills needed for this tutorial beyond elementary command line ability and using a text editor. 

We are going to be using [:material-github: GitHub CodeSpaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces){target=_blank} for the hands on portion of the workshop, which features [:material-microsoft-visual-studio-code: VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target=_blank} as a fully enabled development environment with Docker already installed. 

CodeSpaces is a featured product from GitHub and requires a paid subscription or Academic account for access. Your account will temporarily be integrated with the course GitHub Organization for the next steps in the workshop.

Our instructions on starting a new CodeSpace are [here](https://cc.cyverse.org/cloud/codespaces/){target=_blank}. 

??? Info "Installing Docker on your personal computer"

    We are going to be using virtual machines on the cloud for this course, and we will explain why this is a good thing, but there may be a time when you want to run Docker on your own computer.

    Installing Docker takes a little time but it is reasonably straight forward and it is a one-time setup.

    Installation instructions from Docker Official Docs for common OS and chip architectures:

	- [:fontawesome-brands-apple: Mac OS X](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/){target=_blank}
	- [:fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows){target=_blank}
	- [:fontawesome-brands-ubuntu: Ubuntu Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/){target=_blank}

??? Failure "Never used a terminal before?"
    
    Before venturing much further, you should review the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/){target=_blank} lessons on "The Unix Shell" and "Version Control with Git" -- these are great introductory lessons related to the skills we're teaching here.

    You've given up on ever using a terminal? No problem, Docker can be used from graphic interfaces, like [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/){target=_blank}, or platforms like [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/){target=_blank}. We suggest you read through their documentation on how to use Docker.

## Fundamental Docker Commands :octicons-terminal-16: 

Docker commands in the terminal use the prefix `docker`.

!!! Note "For every command listed, the correct execution of the commands through the command line is by using `docker` in front of the command: for example `docker help` or `docker search`. Thus, every :material-docker: = `docker`."

### :material-docker: help

Like many other command line applications the most helpful flag is the `help` command which can be used with the Management Commands:

``` 
$ docker 
$ docker --help
```

### :material-docker: search

We talk about the concept of [Docker Registries](https://cc.cyverse.org/docker/registry/){target=_blank} in the next section, but you can search the public list of registeries by using the `docker search` command to find public containers on the Official [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com):

```
$ docker search  
```

### :material-docker: pull

Go to the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) and type `hello-world` in the search bar at the top of the page. 

Click on the 'tag' tab to see all the available 'hello-world' images. 

Click the 'copy' icon at the right to copy the `docker pull` command, or type it into your terminal:

```
$ docker pull hello-world
```

!!! Note
        If you leave off the `:` and the tag name, it will by default pull the `latest` image

```
$ docker pull hello-world
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
2db29710123e: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:bfea6278a0a267fad2634554f4f0c6f31981eea41c553fdf5a83e95a41d40c38
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
```

Now try to list the files in your current working directory:

```
$ ls -l
```

??? Question "Where is the image you just pulled?"

    Docker saves container images to the Docker directory (where Docker is installed). 
    
    You won't ever see them in your working directory.

    Use 'docker images' to see all the images on your computer:

    ```
    $ docker images
    ```

### :material-docker: run

The single most common command that you'll use with Docker is `docker run` ([see official help manual](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) for more details).


```
$ docker run hello-world:latest
```

In the demo above, you used the `docker pull` command to download the `hello-world:latest` image.

What about if you run a container that you haven't downloaded?


```
$ docker run alpine:latest ls -l
```

When you executed the command `docker run alpine:latest`, Docker first looked for the cached image locally, but did not find it, it then ran a `docker pull` behind the scenes to download the `alpine:latest` image and then execute your command.

When you ran `docker run alpine:latest`, you provided a command `ls -l`, so Docker started the command specified and you saw the listing of the Alpine file system (not your host system, this was inside the container!).

### :material-docker: images

You can now use the `docker images` command to see a list of all the cached images on your system:

```
$ docker images	
REPOSITORY              TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
alpine                 	latest              c51f86c28340        4 weeks ago         1.109 MB
hello-world             latest              690ed74de00f        5 months ago        960 B
```

??? Info "Inspecting your containers"

	To find out more about a Docker images, run `docker inspect hello-world:latest`

### :material-docker: ps

Now it's time to see the `docker ps` command which shows you all containers that are currently running on your machine. 

```
docker ps
```

Since no containers are running, you see a blank line.

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

Let's try a more useful variant: `docker ps --all`

```
$ docker ps --all
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                            COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES
a5eab9243a15   hello-world                                      "/hello"                 5 seconds ago    Exited (0) 3 seconds ago              loving_mcnulty
3bb4e26d2e0c   alpine:latest                                    "/bin/sh"                17 seconds ago   Exited (0) 16 seconds ago             objective_meninsky
192ffdf0cbae   opensearchproject/opensearch-dashboards:latest   "./opensearch-dashbo…"   3 days ago       Exited (0) 3 days ago                 opensearch-dashboards
a10d47d3b6de   opensearchproject/opensearch:latest              "./opensearch-docker…"   3 days ago       Exited (0) 3 days ago                 opensearch-node1

```

What you see above is a list of all containers that you have run. 

Notice that the `STATUS` column shows the current condition of the container: running, or as shown in the example, when the container was exited.

### :material-docker: stop

The `stop` command is used for containers that are actively running, either as a foreground process or as a detached background one.

You can find a running container using the `docker ps` command.

### :material-docker: rm

You can remove individual stopped containers by using the `rm` command. Use the `ps` command to see all your stopped contiainers:

```
@user ➜ /workspaces $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS     NAMES
03542eaac9dc   hello-world                  "/hello"                 About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago             unruffled_nobel
```

Use the first few unique alphanumerics in the CONTAINER ID to remove the stopped container:

```
@user ➜ /workspaces (mkdocs ✗) $ docker rm 0354
0354
```

Check to see that the container is gone using `ps -a` a second time (`-a` is shorthand for `--all`; the full command is `docker ps -a` or `docker ps --all`).

### :material-docker: rmi

The `rmi` command is similar to `rm` but it will remove the cached images. Used in combination with `docker images` or `docker system df` you can clean up a full cache

```
docker rmi
```

```
@user ➜ /workspaces/ (mkdocs ✗) $ docker images
REPOSITORY                   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
opendronemap/webodm_webapp   latest    e075d13aaf35   21 hours ago   1.62GB

@user ➜ /workspaces (mkdocs ✗) $ 
```

### :material-docker: system

The `system` command can be used to view information about containers on your cache, you can view your total disk usage, view events or info.

You can also use it to `prune` unused data and image layers.

To remove all cached layers, images, and data you can use the `-af` flag for `all` and `force`

```
docker system prune -af
```

### :material-docker: tag

By default an image will recieve the tag `latest` when it is not specified during the `docker build` 

Image names and tags can be created or changed using the `docker tag` command. 

```
docker tag imagename:oldtag imagename:newtag
```

You can also change the registry name used in the tag:

```
docker tag docker.io/username/imagename:oldtag harbor.cyverse.org/project/imagename:newtag
```

The cached image laters will not change their `sha256` and both image tags will still be present after the new tag name is generated.

## Example of Running a Container

This is a tutorial to demonstrate how to run PDAL using Docker. [PDAL](https://pdal.io/en/2.6.0/) is a stand-alone software package that can analyze and manipulate point cloud data files such as .las and .laz. In this tutorial, we will convert a LiDAR .laz file into a [Cloud-optimized Point Cloud format (.copc.laz)](https://www.gillanscience.com/cloud-native-geospatial/copc/). 

#### 1. Clone this repository to your local machine

`git clone https://github.com/jeffgillan/pdal_copc.git`

#### 2. Change directories into the newly cloned repository

`cd pdal_copc`

#### 3. Run the Container

`docker run -v $(pwd):/data jeffgillan/pdal_copc:1.0`

You are mounting a local volume (-v) directory to the container (`/data`). This local directory should have all of the point clouds files you want to convert. `$(pwd)` is telling it that the point clouds are in the current working directory. 

```jeffgillan/pdal_copc:1.0``` is the name of the container image you want to run. 

```jeffgillan``` = the Dockerhub account name

```pdal_copc``` = the name of the image

```1.0``` = the tag name    


Your if everything worked correctly, you should have a new file `tree.copc.laz` in your present working directory.

## Working with Interactive Containers

Let's go ahead and run some Integrated Development Environment images from "trusted" organizations on the Docker Hub Registry.

### :material-language-python: Jupyter Lab 
	
In this section, let's find a Docker image which can run a Jupyter Notebook

Search for official images on Docker Hub which contain the string 'jupyter'

```
$ docker search jupyter
```

It should return something like:

```

```

??? Warning "Untrusted community images"

    An important thing to note: None of these Jupyter or RStudio images are 'official' Docker images, meaning they could be trojans for spyware, malware, or other nasty warez.

---

### Understanding PORTS

When we want to run a container that runs on the open internet, we need to add a [TCP or UDP port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers){target=_blank} from which we can access the application in a browser using the machine's IP (Internet Protocol) address or DNS (Domain Name Service) location.

To do this, we need to access the container over a separate port address on the machine we're working on.

Docker uses the flag `--port` or `-p` for short followed by two sets of port numbers. 

??? Note "Exposing Ports"

    Docker can in fact expose all ports to a container using the capital `-P` flag

    For security purposes, it is generally NEVER a good idea to expose all ports.

Typically these numbers can be the same, but in some cases your machine may already be running another program (or container) on that open port.

The port has two sides `left:right` separated by a colon. The left side port number is the INTERNAL port that the container software thinks its using. The right side number is the EXTERNAL port that you can access on your computer (or virtual machine).

Here are some examples to run basic RStudio and Jupyter Lab:

```
$ docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=cc2022 rocker/rstudio
```

**note: on CodeSpaces, the reverse proxy for the DNS requires you to turn off authentication**

```
$ docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -e DISABLE_AUTH=true rocker/rstudio
```

```
$ docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 jupyter/base-notebook
```
```
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 jupyter/base-notebook start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password=''
```
??? Note "Preempting stale containers from your cache"

	We've added the `--rm` flag, which means the container will automatically removed from the cache when the container is exited.

	When you start an IDE in a terminal, the terminal connection must stay active to keep the container alive.

### Detaching your container while it is running

If we want to keep our window in the foreground  we can use the `-d` - the *detached* flag will run the container as a background process, rather than in the foreground. 

When you run a container with this flag, it will start, run, telling you the container ID:

```
$ docker run --rm -d -p 8888:8888 jupyter/base-notebook
```
Note, that your terminal is still active and you can use it to launch more containers. 

To view the running container, use the `docker ps` command.

---

## Interactive Commands with Containers

Lets try another command, this time to access the container as a shell:

```
$ docker run alpine:latest sh
```

Wait, nothing happened, right? 

Is that a bug? 

Well, no.

The container will exit after running any scripted commands such as `sh`, unless they are run in an "interactive" terminal (TTY) - so for this example to not exit, you need to add the `-i` for interactive and `-t` for TTY. You can run them both in a single flag as `-it`, which is the more common way of adding the flag:

```
$ docker run -it alpine:latest sh
```

The prompt should change to something more like `/ # `.

You are now running a shell inside the container! 

Try out a few commands like `ls -l`, `uname -a` and others.

Exit out of the container by giving the `exit` command.

```
/ # exit
```

??? Warning "Making sure you've exited the container"

	If you type `exit` your **container** will exit and is no longer active. To check that, try the following:

    ```
	$ docker ps --latest
	CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                          PORTS                    NAMES
	de4bbc3eeaec        alpine                "/bin/sh"                3 minutes ago       Exited (0) About a minute ago                            pensive_leavitt
    ```

	If you want to keep the container active, then you can use keys `ctrl +p` `ctrl +q`. To make sure that it is not exited run the same `docker ps --latest` command again:

    ```
	$ docker ps --latest
	CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                         PORTS                    NAMES
	0db38ea51a48        alpine                "sh"                     3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes                                            elastic_lewin
    ```

	Now if you want to get back into that container, then you can type `docker attach <container id>`. This way you can save your container:

	```
    $ docker attach 0db38ea51a48
    ```

---

## :material-home: House Keeping and :material-broom: Cleaning Up Exited Containers

### Managing Docker Images

In the previous example, you pulled the `alpine` image from the registry and asked the Docker client to run a container based on that image. To see the list of images that are available locally on your system, run the `docker images` command.

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ubuntu                     bionic              47b19964fb50        4 weeks ago         88.1MB
alpine                     latest              caf27325b298        4 weeks ago         5.53MB
hello-world                latest              fce289e99eb9        2 months ago        1.84kB
```

Above is a list of images that I've pulled from the registry. You will have a different list of images on your machine. The **TAG** refers to a particular snapshot of the image and the **ID** is the corresponding unique identifier for that image.

For simplicity, you can think of an image akin to a Git repository - images can be committed with changes and have multiple versions. When you do not provide a specific version number, the client defaults to latest.

### Clutter and Cache

Docker images are **cached** on your machine in the location where Docker was installed. These image files are not visible in the same directory where you might have used `docker pull <imagename>`.

Some Docker images can be large. Especially data science images with many scientific programming libraries and packages pre-installed.

Pulling many images from the Docker Registries may fill up your hard disk! To inspect your system and disk use:

```
$ docker system info
$ docker system df
```

To find out how many images are on your machine, type:

```
$ docker images
```

To remove images that you no longer need, type:

```
$ docker system prune
```

This is where it becomes important to differentiate between *images*, *containers*, and *volumes* (which we'll get to more in a bit).  You can take care of all of the dangling images and containers on your system. 

Note, that `prune` will not remove your cached *images* 

```
$ docker system prune
    WARNING! This will remove:
    - all stopped containers
    - all networks not used by at least one container
    - all dangling images
    - all dangling build cache

Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N]
```

If you added the `-af` flag it will remove "all" `-a` dangling images, empty containers, AND ALL CACHED IMAGES with "force" `-f`.

## Managing Data in Docker

It is possible to store data within the writable layer of a container, but there are some limitations:

!!! warning ""
    - **The data doesn’t persist when that container is no longer running**, and it can be difficult to get the data out of the container if another process needs it.
    - **A container’s writable layer is tightly coupled to the host machine where the container is running**. You can’t easily move the data somewhere else.
    - **Its better to put your data into the container *AFTER* it is built** - this keeps the container size smaller and easier to move across networks.

Docker offers three different ways to mount data into a container from the Docker host: **Volumes**, **tmpfs mounts** and **bind mounts**. Here, we will only be exploring *Volumes*.

<figure markdown>
  <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/" target="blank" rel="vol">![vol](https://docs.docker.com/storage/images/types-of-mounts-volume.webp?w=450&h=300) </a>
    <figcaption> The various methods for accessing data using containers. tmpfs mounts store data directly in memory, bind mounts and volumes use the host's file system. Volumes are flexible and only attach a specific directory to the container, whilst bind mounts require the user to share the full path to a file in order to allow the container to access it. Taken from the official Docker documentation on [data management with docker](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). </figcaption>

!!! info "Why Volumes?"

    Volumes are often a better choice than persisting data in a container’s writable layer, because using a volume does not increase the size of containers using it, and the volume’s contents exist outside the lifecycle of a given container. Some of the advantages of volumes include:

    - Volumes are easier to back up or migrate.
    - You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.
    - Volumes work on both UNIX and Windows containers.
    - Volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers.
    - A new volume’s contents can be pre-populated by a container.

The `-v` flag is used for mounting volumes:

`-v` or `--volume`: Consists of three fields, separated by colon characters (:). 

The fields must be in the correct order, and the meaning of each field is not immediately obvious.

Required:

- The **first** field is the path on your **local machine** that where the data are.
- The **second** field is the path where the file or directory are **mounted in the container**.

Optional:

- The third field is optional, and is a comma-separated list of options, such as `ro` (read only).

The synthax looks like the following:
```
-v /home/username/your_data_folder:/container_folder
```

This is what a full docker command with a mounted volume looks like:
```
$ docker run -v /home/$USER/read_cleanup:/work alpine:latest ls -l /work
```

So what if we wanted to work interactively inside the container?

```
$ docker run -it -v /home/$USER/read_cleanup:/work alpine:latest sh
```

Once you're in the container, you will see that the `/work` directory is mounted in the working directory.

Any data that you add to that folder outside the container will appear **INSIDE** the container. And any work you do inside the container saved in that folder will be saved OUTSIDE the container as well.

## Docker Commands

Here is a compiled list of fundamental Docker Commands:

| Command | Usage | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `pull` | Downloads an image from Docker Hub | `docker pull hello-world:latest` |
| `run`  | runs a container with entrypoint | `docker run -it user/image:tag` | 
| `build` | Builds a docker image from a Dockerfile in current working directory | `docker build -t user/image:tag .` |
| `images` |  List all images on the local machine  | `docker images list` |
| `tag` |  Adds a different tag name to an image | `docker tag hello-world:latest hello-world:new-tag-name` |
| `login` | Authenticate to the Docker Hub (requires username and password) | `docker login` |
| `push` | Upload your new image to the Docker Hub | `docker push user/image:tag` |
| `inspect` | Provide detailed information on constructs controlled by Docker | `docker inspect containerID` |
| `ps`  | List all containers on your system  | `docker ps -a` |
| `rm` | Delete a stopped or running container |`docker rm -f <container ID>` |
| `rmi` | Delete an *image* from your cache |  `docker rmi hello-world:latest`  |
| `stop` | Stop a running container | `docker stop alpine:latest` |
| `system` | View system details, remove old images and containers with `prune` |`docker system prune` |
| `push` | Uploads an image to the Docker Hub (or other private registry) | `docker push username/image:tag` |

## Self Assessment

??? Question "A Docker container with the tagname `latest` ensures old code and data will work on a new computer setup?"

    !!! Success "Answer" 

        Never use the `latest` tag for a publication or archival. 

        The `latest` version is always being updated and should be considered "cutting edge".

        `latest` is the default tag name of all Docker images

        `latest` versions MAY have backward compatibility with older code and data, but this is not always a given

??? Question "When are containers the right solution?"

    !!! Success

        Containers are valuable when you need to run an analyses on a remote platform, and you need it to work every time.

    !!! Failure

        You need to do some simple text file editing 

        You need to run a web service
        


??? Question "True or False: Docker containers allow for reproducibility across all computing platforms"

    !!! Success "False"

        While Docker allows you to quickly run software from other people, it may not work across every platform.

        There are different CPU architectures (`arm`, `amd64`, `x64, `x86`) deployed across cloud, computer workstations, laptops, and cellular phones. 

        Docker containers and their software can be cross-compiled across architectures, but this must be done by the creators.

??? Question "When is it advisable to not trust a Docker image?"

    !!! Success "When you cannot view its Dockerfile"

        Featured and Verified Docker images can be trusted, in general.

        User generated images should not be trusted unless you can view their Dockerfile, or build logs to determine what is actually in the container you are attempting to run.
