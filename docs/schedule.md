|---|---|---|---|
| **Week 1** | Sept. 5 | Workshop introduction: <br> - [Intro to Open Science](01_intro_open_sci.md) | In the opening session of FOSS will we talk about the big picture of what Open Science is and why do it. We will discuss how an open approach can be applied to many aspects of the scientific process and enhance your individual research. This is our least technical session where we lay out a roadmap for the 12 week workshop.  |
| **Week 2** | Sept. 12 | [Data management](03_managing_data.md): <br> - [FAIR data](03_managing_data.md#fair-data) <br> - [Data Management Plans](03_managing_data.md#data-management-plans) <br> - Licenses | The foundation of any science endeavor is data. In this session we will dive deep into storing, sharing, and managing your datasets. We'll specifically cover data management plans (DMPs) and explain how licenses can allow other researchers to build on your work. |
| **Week 3** | Sept. 19 | [Documentation / Communication](04_documentation_communication.md): <br> - Internal + External Communication <br> - [GitHub Pages websites](documentation/githubpages.md)  | Beyond publications, researchers and labs that are creating shareable assets (e.g., methods & code) need strong documentation to make those assets usable by the scientific community. In this lesson, we will introduce Github as place to document the IP that you want to share with the world. We'll show you how to make a free website to promote your lab, project, or personal career.    |
