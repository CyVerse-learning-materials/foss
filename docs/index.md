# Welcome to Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS) Fall 2022!

## Workshop Structure

Synchronously, we will meet each week virtually for one and a half to two hours for discussion and hands-on activities with our instructors. 

Each week we will discuss a new topic, ranging from data management to documentation to software management (see [schedule](./schedule.md)). 

Asynchronously, you will read through the online materials (this website and linked websites) and develop your own project-based idea for strenghtening your Open Science skills.

Much of the content interconnects from week to week and many of the skills and approaches we discuss relate to each other. 

Our ultimate goal in this workshop is for you to "level up" one or more of those philosophies/approaches/skills. 

### Capstone Project 

The FOSS workshop asks that you select project that involves a combination of solo and group work. You can read more about it at the [capstone project](./final_project/overview.md) page.

The Capstone Project involves two phases:

Phase 1: will be taking a skill or concept you've learned, generally pertaining to one week's worth of instruction, and putting it into action for one of your own projects. This could be something like improving documentation for an existing project or creating a Data Management Plan for a project proposal.

Phase 2: working with a group of other FOSS learners who tackled your same topic. Together, you will discuss challenges, tips, and next steps for that topic, and put together a short presentation that will be delivered to the rest of the FOSS attendees durning our final meeting.

## Expected Outcomes

-   Proficiently organize your lab, external and internal communications, and teach and conduct research with open source software
-   Ability to scale out computations from laptop to the cloud and High Performance Computing / High Throughput Computing systems
-   Skillfully manage your research data through the data lifecycle 
-   Join a larger community of Open Science practitioners
-   Be an Advocate for Open Science in your professional circles and communities

By working through an example project relevant to your interests, you will practice open science skills using CyVerse, GitHub, R or Python, and other resources. At the end of the course, you and your team will present a plan for how to integrate open science into your research, lab, or other areas of your choosing.
