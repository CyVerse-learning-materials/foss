# Welcome to Foundational Open Science Skills!

Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS) is a novel, camp-style training
designed to prepare principal investigators and their lab teams, both
new and established, to meet the growing expectations of funding
agencies, publishers, and research institutions for scientific
reproducibility and data accessibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Expected outcomes

-   Proficiently organize your lab, communications, and research with
    productivity software
-   Capably scale out your computation from laptop to cloud and HPC
    systems
-   Skillfully manage the data lifecycle for open science and
    reproducibility
-   Connect with colleagues across institutional boundaries and research
    domains
-   Engage with the community of Open Science practitioners

By working through an example project relevant to your interests, you
will practice open science skills using CyVerse, GitHub, R or Python,
and other resources. At the end of the course, you and your team will
present a plan for how to integrate open science into your research,
lab, or other areas of your choosing.
