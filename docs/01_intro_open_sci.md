**:material-pillar: Open Access Publications**

**:material-pillar: Open Data**

**:material-pillar: Open Educational Resources**

**:material-pillar: Open Methodology**
      
**:material-pillar: Open Peer Review**

**:material-pillar: Open Source Software**

??? Question "Wait, how many pillars :material-pillar: of Open Science Are There Really?"

    The number can be from [4 :material-pillar:](https://narratives.insidehighered.com/four-pillars-of-open-science/){target=_blank} to [8 :material-pillar:](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/research-support/open-science/8-pillars-open-science){target=_blank}


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **:material-pillar: Open Access Publications**

[![open access](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Open_Access_PLoS.svg){width=210}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access){target=_blank}

!!! Quote "Definition"

    "Open access is a publishing model for scholarly communication that makes research information available to readers at no cost, as opposed to the traditional subscription model in which readers have access to scholarly information by paying a subscription (usually via libraries)." -- [OpenAccess.nl](https://www.openaccess.nl/en/what-is-open-access){target=_blank}

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Types of Publishing Business Models:

1. Subscription model - the author pays a smaller fee (or no fee) for the article to be published. The publisher then sells subscription access to the article (usually to institutes of higher education).

2. Open Access model - The author pays a larger fee to make the article freely available to anyone through a Creative Commons license. 

    * Open Access publishing in Nature costs $12,290!
    * Open Access publising in PlosOne costs $2,290

<br>
<br>
<br>

### New Open Access Mandates in US

The White House Office of Science and Technology (OSTP) has recently released a policy document known as the [Nelson Memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/) stating that tax-payer funded research must by open access by 2026 with no embargo period. 

Authors can comply with the memo by either:

1. Publishing Open Access (this usually requires higher fees)

2. Distributing the Author's Accepted Manuscript (AAM) 

Read [NSF's open access plan](NSF’s Public Access Plan 2.0 is document NSF 23-104) in reponse to the Nelson Memo

Read [USDA's open access plan](https://www.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/page-files/USDA_Public_Access_Implementation_Plan_8_10_2023_0.pdf) in reponse to the Nelson Memo

## **:material-pillar: Open Data**

<br>

!!! Quote "Definitions"

    “Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose” - [The Open Definition](https://opendefinition.org/){target=_blank}

    "Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike." - [Open Data Handbook](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/){target=_blank}

### FAIR Principles

In 2016, the [FAIR Guiding Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) for scientific data management and stewardship were published in _Scientific Data_. 

_**Findable:**_
Making data discoverable by the wider academic community and the public

_**Accessible:**_
Using unique identifiers, metadata and a clear use of language and access protocols

_**Interoperable:**_
Applying standards to encode and exchange data and metadata

_**Reusable:**_
Enabling the repurposing of researach outputs to maximize their research potential


<br>
<br>

!!! Tip "Reasons to Make your Data Open"

    * Unnecessary duplication e.g. re-collecting or re-working data, can be avoided. Duplication of research is costly for society, and places unnecessary burden on heavily researched people and populations.  

    * The data underlying publications are maintained and accessible, allowing for validation of results.

    * Data openness leads to more collaboration and advances research and innovation.

    * Your research is more visible and has greater impact. Publications which allow access to the underlying data get more citations. Greater visibility also allows for better validation and scrutiny of findings.

    * Other researchers can cite your data, which will drive up your citation number and increase your influence in your field of research.

    * Storing your data in a public repository also provides you with secure and ongoing storage that may otherwise not be available to you.

            - Borrowed From [Foster Open Science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/)


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### As Open as Possible, as Closed as Necessary

There are many circumstances where open data could be harmful:

* Data on human health

* Location of endangered species or archaeological sites

* Data that individuals or groups do not want to be public

    ??? Tip "CARE Principles"

        The [CARE Principles](https://www.gida-global.org/care) for Indigenous Data Governance were drafted at the International Data Week and Research Data Alliance Plenary co-hosted event "Indigenous Data Sovereignty Principles for the Governance of Indigenous Data Workshop," 8 November 2018, Gaborone, Botswana.

         *Collective Benefit*

         -   C1. For inclusive development and innovation
         -   C2. For improved governance and citizen engagement
         -   C3. For equitable outcomes

         *Authority to Control*

         -   A1. Recognizing rights and interests
         -   A2. Data for governance
         -   A3. Governance of data

         *Responsibility*

         -   R1. For positive relationships
         -   R2. For expanding capability and capacity
         -   R3. For Indigenous languages and worldviews

         *Ethics*

         -   E1. For minimizing harm and maximizing benefit
         -   E2. For justice
         -   E3. For future use

* Data for making [lethal weapons](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22983197/ai-new-possible-chemical-weapons-generative-models-vx)

<br>
<br>

!!! Tip "Open vs. FAIR"

    FAIR does not demand that data be open: See one definition of open: http://opendefinition.org/
    
    Open data does not necessarily mean it is FAIR

### Preregistration

In response to the Reproducibility Crisis, many researchers, particularly in fields like psychology, have begun to advocate for **preregistration** of studies. 

This involves writing out and publishing your entire research plan, from data collection to analysis and publication, for the sake of avoiding practices like [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging){target=_blank} or [HARKing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HARKing){target=_blank}. 

What preregistration also does is make the process of your work more open, including many of the small decisions and tweaks you make to a project that probably wouldn't make it into a manuscript. 

 You can also read this publication by [Nosek et al. 2018](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1708274114){target=_blank}

## **:material-pillar: Open Peer Review**

<br> 
<br> 


!!! Quote "Definitions"

    Open peer review is an umbrella term for a number of overlapping ways that peer review models can be adapted in line with the aims of Open Science, including making reviewer and author identities open, publishing review reports and enabling greater participation in the peer review process.  
    
    [-Ross-Hellauer et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.12688%2Ff1000research.11369.2)

    <br>

    [:material-wikipedia: Wikipedia's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review)

<br>
<br>
<br>


### In a Traditional Closed Peer-review system, a submitted manuscript is:

- Read by an associate editor at the journal who decides whether to reject the paper or send it out for review
- Reviewed by 2 or 3 researchers in the field who analyze the soundness of the research and provide recommendations for acceptance or rejection
- Evaluated by the editor, who makes a final decision based on the reviews and communicates to the author whether the paper is accepted, rejected, or requires revision and resubmission.
- Throughout and after the process, the author remains unaware of the reviewers' identities, while the reviewers know the identity of the authors. 
- All communications between authors, reviewers and editors remains private 

<br>
<br>

### Complaints with the Traditional Closed Peer-Review System

* Unreliable and Inconsistent

* Delays and Expense

* Lack of Accountability and Risks of Subversion

* Social and Publication Biases

* Lack of Incentives

## Breakout Discussion 1

As you already know, being a scientist requires you to wear many hats, and trying to do Open Science is no different.

To get a feel for how Open Science can be multifaceted and different for each researcher, we will do a short breakout group session to discuss what Open Science means to you.

??? Question "What does Open Science mean to you?"

    ??? Example "Which of the :material-pillar: pillars of Open Science is nearest to your own heart?"

        **:material-pillar: Open Access Publications**

        **:material-pillar: Open Data**

        **:material-pillar: Open Educational Resources**

        **:material-pillar: Open Methodology**
      
        **:material-pillar: Open Peer Review**

        **:material-pillar: Open Source Software**

    ??? Example "Are any of the :material-pillar: pillars more important than the others?"

    ??? Example "Are there any :material-pillar: pillars not identified that you think should be considered?"

??? Question "What characteristics might a paper, project, lab group require to qualify as doing *Open Science*"

??? Question "What are some limitations to you, your lab group, or your domain?"

## *WHY* do Open Science?

There are many reasons to do Open Science, and presumably one or more of them brought you to this workshop. 

Whether you feel an ethical obligation, want to improve the quality of your work, or want to look better to funding agencies, many of the same approaches to Open Science apply.

A paper from [Bartling & Friesike (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8){target=_blank} posits that there are 5 main schools of thought in Open Science, which represent 5 underlying motivations:

1.  **Democratic school**: primarily concerned with making scholarly work freely available to everyone

2.  **Pragmatic school**: primarily concerned with improving the quality of scholarly work by fostering collaboration and improving critiques

3.  **Infrastructure school**: primarily focused on the platforms, tools, and services necessary to conduct efficient research, collaboration, and communication

4.  **Public school**: primarily concerned with societal impact of scholarly work, focusing on engagement with broader public via citizen science, understandable scientific communication, and less formal communication

5.  **Measurement school**: primarily concerned with the existing focus on journal publications as a means of measuring scholarly output, and focused on developing alternative measurements of scientific impact

</figure>

While many researchers may be motivated by one or more of these aspects, we will not necessarily focus on any of them in particular. If anything, FOSS may be slightly more in the Infrastructure school, because we aim to give you the tools to do Open Science based on your own underlying motivations.

## Breakout Discussion 2

Let's break out into groups again to discuss some of our motivations for doing Open Science.

??? Question "What motivates you to do Open Science?"

??? Question "Do you feel that you fall into a particular "school"? If so, which one, and why?"

??? Question "Are there any motivating factors for doing Open Science that don't fit into this framework?"

## Ethos of Open Science

Doing Open Science requires us to understand the ethics of why working with data which do not belong to us is privileged.

We must also anticipate how these could be re-used [in ways contrary to the interests of humanity](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22983197/ai-new-possible-chemical-weapons-generative-models-vx){target=_blank}. 

Ensure the use of [Institutional Review Boards (IRB)](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder/institutional-review-boards-irbs-and-protection-human-subjects-clinical-trials){target=_blank} or your local ethical committee.

## Self Assessment

??? Question "True or False: All research papers published in the top journals, like Science and Nature, are always Open Access?"

    ??? Success "Answer"

        False

        Major Research journals like [Science](https://www.science.org/content/page/open-access-aaas){target=_blank} and [Nature](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/open-access){target=_blank} have an "Open Access" option when a manuscript is accepted, but they charge an extra fee to the authors to make those papers Open Access.

        These [high page costs](https://www.science.org/content/article/9500-nature-journals-will-now-make-your-paper-free-read){target=_blank} are exclusionary to the majority of global scientists who cannot afford to front these costs out of pocket.

        This will soon change, at least in the United States. The [Executive Branch of the federal government recently mandated](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02351-1){target=_blank} that future federally funded research be made Open Access after 2026.


??? Question "True or False: an article states all of the research data used in the experiments "are available upon request from the corresponding author(s)," meaning the data are "Open""

    ??? Success "Answer"

        False

        In order for research to be open, the data need to be freely available from a digital repository, like [Data Dryad](https://datadryad.org){target=_blank}, [Zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org){target=_blank}, or [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/data-commons){target=_blank}.

        Data that are 'available upon request' do not meet the FAIR data principles. 

??? Question "True or False: Online Universities and Data Science Boot Camps like UArizona Online, Coursera, Udemy, etc. promote digital literacy and are Open Educational Resources?"

    ??? Success "Answer"

        False

        These examples are for-profit programs which teach data science and computer programming online. Some may be official through public or private universities and offer credits toward a degree or a certificate. Some of these programs are [known to be predatory](https://www.highereddive.com/news/court-fines-ashford-university-and-zovio-224m-for-misleading-students/620058/){target=_blank}.

        The organizations we have [listed above](#material-pillar-open-educational-resources) are Open Educational Resources - they are free and available to anyone who wants to work with them asynchronously, virtually, or in person.

??? Question "Using a version control system to host the analysis code and computational notebooks, and including these in your Methods section or Supplementary Materials, is an example of an Open Methodology?"

    ??? Success "Answer"

        Yes!

        Using a VCS like GitHub or GitLab is a great step towards making your research more reproducible. 

        Ways to improve your open methology can include documentation of your physical bench work, and even video recordings and step-by-step guides for every part of your project.

??? Question "You are asked to review a paper for an important journal in your field. The editor asks if you're willing to release your identity to the authors, thereby "signing" your review. Is this an example of "Open Peer Review"?"

    ??? Success "Answer"

        No

        Just because you've given your name to the author(s) of the manuscript, this does not make your review open.

        If the journal later publishes your review alongside the final manuscript, than you will have participated in an Open Review. 

??? Question "You read a paper where the author(s) wrote their own code and licensed as "Open Source" software for a specific set of scientific tasks which you want to replicate. When you visit their personal website, you find the GitHub repository does not exist (because its now private). You contact the authors asking for access, but they refuse to share it 'due to competing researchers who are seeking to steal their intellectual property". Is the software open source?"

    ??? Success "Answer"

        No

        Just because an author states they have given their software a permissive software license, does not make the software open source. 

        Always make certain there is a [LICENSE](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/){target=_blank} associated with any software you find on the internet. 

        In order for the software to be open, it must follow the [Open Source Initiative definition](https://opensource.org/osd){target=_blank}
