## What is Open Science?

<br>

<span style="font-size:1.3em;">_"Open Science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks"_</span>

[-Vincente-Saez & Martinez-Fuentes 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.12.043)

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="font-size:1.3em;">_"Open Science is a collaborative and transparent approach to scientific research that emphasizes the accessibility, sharing, and reproducibility of data, methodologies, and findings to foster innovation and inclusivity"_</span>

-ChatGPT

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **:material-pillar: 6 Pillars of Open Science**

**:material-pillar: Open Access Publications**

**:material-pillar: Open Data**

**:material-pillar: Open Educational Resources**

**:material-pillar: Open Methodology**
      
**:material-pillar: Open Peer Review**

**:material-pillar: Open Source Software**

??? Question "Wait, how many pillars :material-pillar: of Open Science Are There Really?"

    The number can be from [4 :material-pillar:](https://narratives.insidehighered.com/four-pillars-of-open-science/){target=_blank} to [8 :material-pillar:](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/research-support/open-science/8-pillars-open-science){target=_blank}

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **:material-pillar: Open Access Publications**

[![open access](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Open_Access_PLoS.svg){width=210}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access){target=_blank}

!!! Quote "Definition"

    "Open access is a publishing model for scholarly communication that makes research information available to readers at no cost, as opposed to the traditional subscription model in which readers have access to scholarly information by paying a subscription (usually via libraries)." -- [OpenAccess.nl](https://www.openaccess.nl/en/what-is-open-access){target=_blank}

<br>
<br>
<br>

!!! Example "Open Access Journal Examples"

    Major publishers have provided access points for publishing your work 

    - [AAAS Science](https://www.science.org/content/page/open-access-aaas){target=_blank}
    - [Nature](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/open-access){target=_blank}
    - [American Geophysical Union](https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Open-Access){target=_blank}
    - [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)](https://acsopenscience.org/australia-csiro/){target=_blank}
    - [Open Research Europe](https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/){target=_blank}
    - [PLOS](https://plos.org/){target=_blank}
    - [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/){target=_blank}
    - [Ecosphere](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/21508925){target=_blank}

<br>
<br>

### Types of Publishing Business Models:

1. Subscription model - the author pays a smaller fee (or no fee) for the article to be published. The publisher then sells subscription access to the article (usually to institutes of higher education).

2. Open Access model - The author pays a larger fee to make the article freely available to anyone through a Creative Commons license. 

    - Open Access publishing in Nature costs $12,290!
    - Open Access publising in PlosOne costs $2,290

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Research Article Versions 

1. Preprint - In academic publishing, a preprint is a version of scholary paper that precedes formal peer-review and publication in a scientific journal. The preprint may be available, often as a non-typeset version available for free online. 

    ??? Example "Pre-print Services"

        - [ASAPbio Pre-Print Server List](https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers){target=_blank} - ASAPbio is a scientist-driven non-profit promoting transparency and innovation comprehensive list of pre-print servers inthe field of life science communication.

        - [Peer Community In (PCI)](https://peercommunityin.org/) a free recommendation process of scientific preprints based on peer reviews
        - [OSF.io Preprints](https://osf.io/preprints/){target=_blank} are partnered with numerous projects under the "-rXivs"

        ??? Tip "The rXivs"

            - [AfricArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/africarxiv/){target=_blank}

            - [AgrirXiv](https://cabidigitallibrary.org/journal/agrirxiv){target=_blank}

            - [Arabixiv](https://arabixiv.org/discover){target=_blank}

            - [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/){target=_blank} - is a free distribution service and an open-access archive for 2,086,431 scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.

            - [BioHackrXiv](https://biohackrxiv.org/){target=_blank}
            - [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/){target=_blank} -  is an open access preprint repository for the biological sciences.

2. Author's accepted manuscript (AAM) - includes changes that came about during peer-review process. It is a non-typeset or formatted article. This often had an embargo period of 12-24 months

3. Published version of record (VOR) - includes stylistic edits, online & print formatting. This is the version that publishers claim ownership of with copyrights or exclusive licensing. 

<br>
<br>

??? Tip "Copyrights and Science Publishing"

    Upon completion of a peer-reviewed science paper, the author typically 1. signs over the copyright of the paper to the publisher or 2. signs an exclusive license agreement with the publisher

    For example authors that publish in [_Science_](https://www.science.org/content/page/science-journals-editorial-policies#copyright-license-to-publish) retain their copyright but sign a 'license to pubish' agreement with AAAS

    Elsevier requires authors to sign over copyright of the article but authors retains some rights of distribution

<br>
<br>

### New Open Access Mandates in US

The White House Office of Science and Technology (OSTP) has recently released a policy document known as the [Nelson Memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/) stating that tax-payer funded research must by open access by 2026 with no embargo period. 

Authors can comply with the memo by either:

1. Publishing Open Access (this usually requires higher fees)
2. Distributing the Author's Accepted Manuscript (AAM) 

Read [NSF's open access plan](NSF’s Public Access Plan 2.0 is document NSF 23-104) in reponse to the Nelson Memo

Read [USDA's open access plan](https://www.nal.usda.gov/sites/default/files/page-files/USDA_Public_Access_Implementation_Plan_8_10_2023_0.pdf) in reponse to the Nelson Memo

!!! Quote "Definitions"

    “Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose” - [The Open Definition](https://opendefinition.org/){target=_blank}

    "Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike." - [Open Data Handbook](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/){target=_blank}

### FAIR Principles

In 2016, the [FAIR Guiding Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) for scientific data management and stewardship were published in _Scientific Data_. 

_**Findable:**_
Making data discoverable by the wider academic community and the public

_**Accessible:**_
Using unique identifiers, metadata and a clear use of language and access protocols

_**Interoperable:**_
Applying standards to encode and exchange data and metadata

_**Reusable:**_
Enabling the repurposing of researach outputs to maximize their research potential

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

!!! Tip "Reasons to Make your Data Open"

    - Unnecessary duplication. Duplication of research is costly for society, and places unnecessary burden on heavily researched people and populations.  
    - The data underlying publications are maintained and accessible, allowing for validation of results.
    - Data openness leads to more collaboration and advances research and innovation.
    - Your research is more visible and has greater impact. Publications which allow access to the underlying data get more citations. Greater visibility also allows for better validation and scrutiny of findings.
    - Other researchers can cite your data, which will drive up your citation number and increase your influence in your field of research.
    - Storing your data in a public repository also provides you with secure and ongoing storage that may otherwise not be available to you.
    -[Foster Open Science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/)


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### As Open as Possible, as Closed as Necessary

There are many circumstances where open data could be harmful:

- Data on human health

- Location of endangered species or archaeological sites

- Data that individuals or groups do not want to be public

    ??? Tip "CARE Principles"

        The [CARE Principles](https://www.gida-global.org/care) for Indigenous Data Governance were drafted at the International Data Week and Research Data Alliance Plenary co-hosted event "Indigenous Data Sovereignty Principles for the Governance of Indigenous Data Workshop," 8 November 2018, Gaborone, Botswana.

         *Collective Benefit*

         -   C1. For inclusive development and innovation
         -   C2. For improved governance and citizen engagement
         -   C3. For equitable outcomes

         *Authority to Control*

         -   A1. Recognizing rights and interests
         -   A2. Data for governance
         -   A3. Governance of data

         *Responsibility*

         -   R1. For positive relationships
         -   R2. For expanding capability and capacity
         -   R3. For Indigenous languages and worldviews

         *Ethics*

         -   E1. For minimizing harm and maximizing benefit
         -   E2. For justice
         -   E3. For future use

* Data for making [lethal weapons](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22983197/ai-new-possible-chemical-weapons-generative-models-vx)

<br>
<br>

!!! Tip "Open vs. FAIR"

    FAIR does not demand that data be open: See one definition of open: http://opendefinition.org/
    
    Open data does not necessarily mean it is FAIR

## **:material-pillar: Open Methodology**

<br>

!!! Quote "Definitions"

    "An open methodology is simply one which has been described in sufficient detail to allow other researchers to repeat the work and apply it elsewhere." - [Watson (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0669-2){target=_blank}

    "Open Methodology refers to opening up methods that are used by researchers to achieve scientific results and making them publicly available." - [Open Science Network Austria](https://www.oana.at/en/about-open-science){target=_blank}

<br>
<br>

### Sharing Research Computer Code

Scientists around the globe are creating computer code for scientific analysis. These are valuable contributions that need to be shared!

Platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=open+science){target=_blank} and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/explore/projects/topics/Open%20Science){target=_blank} are ideal for collaboratively developing code and sharing with the open internet. In FOSS, we will show you how to use Github for sharing code, [documentation](04_documentation_communication.md), [hosting websites](04_documentation_communication.md), and [software version control](05_version_control.md).

### PreRegistration

Preregistration is detailing your research and analysis plan and submitting it to an online registry **before** you engage in the research. 

<figure markdown>
  <a target="blank" rel="open science">![open science](../assets/cycle_prereg.png){ width="500" } </a>
    <figcaption> PreRegistration in the Research Life Cycle</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Why Do This?

Preregistration makes your process more open and records the difference between your initial research plan what you end up actually doing.

Preregistration separates _hypothesis-generating_  (exploratory) from _hypothesis-testing_ (confirmatory) research. Both are important. But the same data cannot be used to generate and test a hypothesis, which can happen unintentionally and reduce the credibility of your results. 

It also helps us avoid practices like [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging){target=_blank} or [Hypothesizing After the Results are Known(HARKing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HARKing){target=_blank}.

<br> 


!!! Quote "Definitions"

    Open peer review is an umbrella term for a number of overlapping ways that peer review models can be adapted in line with the aims of Open Science, including making reviewer and author identities open, publishing review reports and enabling greater participation in the peer review process.

## *WHY* do Open Science?


A paper from [Bartling & Friesike (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8){target=_blank} posits that there are 5 main schools of thought in Open Science, which represent 5 underlying motivations:

1.  **Democratic school**: primarily concerned with making scholarly work freely available to everyone
2.  **Pragmatic school**: primarily concerned with improving the quality of scholarly work by fostering collaboration and improving critiques
3.  **Infrastructure school**: primarily focused on the platforms, tools, and services necessary to conduct efficient research, collaboration, and communication
4.  **Public school**: primarily concerned with societal impact of scholarly work, focusing on engagement with broader public via citizen science, understandable scientific communication, and less formal communication
5.  **Measurement school**: primarily concerned with the existing focus on journal publications as a means of measuring scholarly output, and focused on developing alternative measurements of scientific impact
6. **Compliance school**: government, universities, and granting agencies have embraced Open Science and are mandating some elements (e.g., data sharing with publications)

## Self Assessment

??? Question "True or False: All research papers published in the top journals, like Science and Nature, are always Open Access?"

    ??? Success "Answer"

        False

        Major Research journals like [Science](https://www.science.org/content/page/open-access-aaas){target=_blank} and [Nature](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/open-access){target=_blank} have an "Open Access" option when a manuscript is accepted, but they charge an extra fee to the authors to make those papers Open Access.

        These [high page costs](https://www.science.org/content/article/9500-nature-journals-will-now-make-your-paper-free-read){target=_blank} are exclusionary to the majority of global scientists who cannot afford to front these costs out of pocket.

        This will soon change, at least in the United States. The [Executive Branch of the federal government recently mandated](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02351-1){target=_blank} that future federally funded research be made Open Access after 2026.


??? Question "True or False: an article states all of the research data used in the experiments "are available upon request from the corresponding author(s)," meaning the data are "Open""

    ??? Success "Answer"

        False

        In order for research to be open, the data need to be freely available from a digital repository, like [Data Dryad](https://datadryad.org){target=_blank}, [Zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org){target=_blank}, or [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/data-commons){target=_blank}.

        Data that are 'available upon request' do not meet the FAIR data principles. 



??? Question "Using a version control system to host the analysis code and computational notebooks, and including these in your Methods section or Supplementary Materials, is an example of an Open Methodology?"

    ??? Success "Answer"

        Yes!

        Using a VCS like GitHub or GitLab is a great step towards making your research more reproducible. 

        Ways to improve your open methology can include documentation of your physical bench work, and even video recordings and step-by-step guides for every part of your project.

??? Question "You are asked to review a paper for an important journal in your field. The editor asks if you're willing to release your identity to the authors, thereby "signing" your review. Is this an example of "Open Peer Review"?"

    ??? Success "Answer"

        Maybe

        There are many opinions on what 'open-review' should consist of. A reviewer signing their review and releasing their identity to the authors is a step toward a more open process. However, it is far less open than publishing the peer-review reports online next to the final published paper. 


??? Question "You read a paper where the author(s) wrote their own code and licensed as "Open Source" software for a specific set of scientific tasks which you want to replicate. When you visit their personal website, you find the GitHub repository does not exist (because its now private). You contact the authors asking for access, but they refuse to share it 'due to competing researchers who are seeking to steal their intellectual property". Is the software open source?"

    ??? Success "Answer"

        No

        Just because an author states they have given their software a permissive software license, does not make the software open source. 

        Always make certain there is a [LICENSE](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/){target=_blank} associated with any software you find on the internet. 

        In order for the software to be open, it must follow the [Open Source Initiative definition](https://opensource.org/osd){target=_blank}
