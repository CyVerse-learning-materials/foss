??? Question "Explanining the quadrants"

    - **Tutorials**: Lessons! Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand to understand how the basics of a tool work. They are what your project needs in order to show a beginner that they can achieve something with it. The techical teaching we do in FOSS are mostly tutorials. For example, we do simple tutorials to teach the mechanics of version control. 
    - **How-to-guides**: Recipes! How-to-guides take the reader through the steps required to acheive a specific outcome or answer a specific question. An example how-to-guide could be a guide on how to install a specific software on a specific operating system.
    - **References**: References offer technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. References have one job only: to describe. They are code-determined, because ultimately that’s what they describe: key classes, functions, APIs, and so they should list things like functions, fields, attributes and methods, and set out how to use them.
    - **Explanation**: Discussions! The aims of explanations are to clarify and illuminate a particular topic by broadening the documentation’s coverage of a topic.

<br/>

### Tips for Great Documentation
- **:material-glasses: Clarity**: Documentation should be easy to understand with clear language and no ambiguity.
- **:octicons-circle-16: Completeness**: It must cover all essential details, leaving nothing crucial undocumented.
- **:fontawesome-solid-bullseye: Accuracy**: Information should be up-to-date and correct to prevent errors and misunderstandings.
- **:simple-instructure: Organization**: A logical structure and clear organization make it easy to navigate and find information.
- **:fontawesome-solid-exclamation: Relevance**: Documentation should focus on what's pertinent to its intended audience or purpose, avoiding unnecessary information.

### Public Repositories for Documentation



??? "*:simple-github: GitHub Readme*"

    - On Github, good documentation starts with a robust ReadMe file. The ReadMe file is the first thing that people see when they visit your repository. It is a good place to explain what your project does, how to use it, and how to contribute to it. Here is an [example](https://github.com/jeffgillan/geospatial_pipeline).
    



??? "*:simple-github: GitHub Wiki*"

    -  Also on Github, you can use the Wiki feature to create a separate space for documentation. The Wiki is a place to document your project in a way that is separate from the code. Here is an [example](https://github.com/ua-datalab/Geospatial_Workshops/wiki)


??? "*:simple-github: GitHub Pages*"

    -  [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are hosted directly from your GitHub repository
    -  GitHub pages are free, fast, and easy to build, but limited in use
    of subdomain or URLs
    -  You can pull templates from other GitHub users for your website, e.g. [:simple-jekyll: Jekyll themes](http://themes.jekyllrc.org/){target=_blank}
    -  The FOSS website is rendered using [:simple-github: GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){target=_blank} using [:simple-markdown: MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/){target=_blank} and the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){target=_blank} theme for MkDocs.
    -  Other popular website generator for GitHub Pages is [:simple-bootstrap: Bootstrap.js](https://getbootstrap.com/){target=_blank}.

??? "*:simple-markdown: Material MkDocs*"

    -  [Material Design](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){target=_blank} theme for MkDocs, a static site generator geared towards (technical) project documentation.
    -  Publish via GitHub Actions
    -  Uses open source Material or ReadTheDocs Themes

??? "*:simple-readthedocs: ReadTheDocs*"

    -   publishing websites via
    [ReadTheDocs.com](https://readthedocs.com/dashboard/){target=_blank} costs money.
    -   You can work in an offline state, where you develop the materials
    and publish them to your localhost using
    [Sphinx](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html){target=_blank}
    -   You can work on a website template in a GitHub repository, and
    pushes are updated in near real time using ReadTheDocs.com.
    -   Here is example documentation of Pytorch using ReadTheDocs: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html){target=_blank}.


??? "*:material-book-arrow-down: Bookdown*"

    -   [:material-book-arrow-down: Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/){target=_blank} is an open-source R package that facilitates writing books and long-form articles/reports with R Markdown.
    -   Bookdown websites can be hosted by [RStudio
    Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/){target=_blank}
    -   You can publish a Bookdown website using [Github
    Pages](https://github.blog/2016-08-17-simpler-github-pages-publishing/){target=_blank}


??? "*:simple-r: Quarto*"

    -   [:simple-r: Quarto](https://quarto.org/){target=_blank} is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc
    -   [Build a website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) using Quarto's template builder
    -   [Build with Github Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html)

??? "*:simple-jupyter: JupyterBook*"

    -   [Based on Project Jupyter](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/overview.html){target=_blank} `ipynb` and MarkDown
    -   Uses `conda` package management

??? "*:simple-git: GitBook*"

    - [GitBook](https://docs.gitbook.com/){target=_blank} websites use MarkDown syntax
    - Free for open source projects, paid plans are available

??? "*:simple-confluence: Confluence Wikis*"

    -   [:simple-confluence: Confluence Wikis](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/use-cases/wiki){target=_blank} are another tool for documenting your work. You can see an example from [Cyverse](https://wiki.cyverse.org){target=_blank}.

<br/>

!!! Quote "Things to remember about Documentation"

    - Documentation should be written in such a way that people who did not write the documentation can read and then use or read and then teach others in the applications of the material.

    - Documentation is best treated as a living document, but version control is necessary to maintain it

    - Technology changes over time, expect to refresh documentation every 3-5 years as your projects age and progress.

!!! info "Public Communication"

    Communicating with the public and other members of your science community (in addition to traditional peer-review publications and conferences) is one of the most important parts of your science!

    There are many ways scientists use social media and the web to share their data science ideas:

    1.  **[:material-twitter: "Science Twitter" (now :fontawesome-brands-x-twitter:)](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/08/scientists-do-you-want-succeed-twitter-here-s-how-many-followers-you-need){target=_blank}** -
        is really just regular [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/science?lang=en){target=_blank}, but with a focus on following other scientists and organizations, and tweeting about research you're interested in. By building up a significant following, more people will know you, know about your work, and you'll have a higher likelihood of meeting other new collaborators.    
        - Since the rebranding to :fontawesome-brands-x-twitter:, a lot of the scientific communities on Twitter have now moved to [:simple-mastodon: Mastodon](https://sciencemastodon.com/explore), an [open-source](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon) self-hosted alternative to social media.
    2.  **Blogging Platforms** such as [Medium](https://medium.com/){target=_blank} are a great place to self publish your writing on just about any topic. It's free to sign up and start blogging, but does have a fee for accessing premium content. Some of my favorite blogs include [Toward Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/){target=_blank} and [Chris Holmes](https://medium.com/@cholmes){target=_blank}.
    3.  **Community groups** - There are lists (and lists of lists) of [nationals research organizations](https://www.google.com/search?q=list+of+professional+science+organizations){target=_blank}, in which a researcher can become involved. These older organziations
        still rely on official websites, science journal blogs, and email lists to communicate with their members. In the earth sciences there are open groups which focus on communication like the [Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP)](https://www.esipfed.org/){target=_blank} with progressive ideas about how data and science can be done. Other groups, like [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/){target=_blank} and [Research Bazaar](https://resbazblog.wordpress.com/about/){target=_blank} are focused on data science training and digital literacy.
    4.  **Podcasts** - Creating and distributing audio content to masses is easier than ever before. There are many podcast hosting platforms including [Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/){target=_blank}, [Podbean](https://www.podbean.com/){target=_blank}, [Acast](https://www.acast.com/){target=_blank}, and [Libsyn](https://libsyn.com/){target=_blank}. From there is it simple to make your podcast availble in the [Google Podcast](https://rss.com/blog/how-to-submit-podcast-to-google-podcasts/){target=_blank} app or [Apple Podcast](https://transistor.fm/upload-podcast-itunes-apple/){target=_blank} app. 
    5.  **Webinars** - With platforms such as [Zoom](https://zoom.us/){target=_blank}, [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software){target=_blank}, and [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/){target=_blank}, it is so easy nowadays to host a webinar touting and explaining your science. 
    6.  **Youtube** - The king of video sharing platforms is a great place to post content promoting your science (and yourself!). For example, [Cyverse](https://www.youtube.com/@CyverseOrgProject){target=_blank} posts lots of content on cyberinfrastructure and data processing pipelines. Some of my favorite podcasts hosted on Youtube include [StarTalk](https://www.youtube.com/@StarTalk){target=_blank} and [Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman){target=_blank}.
        - CyVerse and the Data Science Institute have a number of videos that can help you expand your science. Navigate our [DataLab YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@UArizonaDataLab/videos) to learn more on AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), geospatial science, bioinformatics/genomics and project management; Go to our [CyVerse Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CyverseOrgProject) to see the various projects CyVerse is involved in, or learn tips and tricks on how CyVerse works.

    !!! Warning "Important"
        **Remember: Personal and Professional Accounts are Not Isolated**

        You decide what you post on the internet. Your scientist identity may be
        a part of your personal identity on social media, it might be separate.
        A future employer or current employer can see your old posts. What you
        post in your personal accounts can be considered a reflection of the
        organization you work for and may be used in decisions about hiring or
        dismissal.

## Hands-on: Building a GitHub Pages Website using MkDocs

This section is built in order to educate on and simplify the steps necessary that newcomers need to take in order to build a successful GitHub Pages hosted website. 

 This tutorial is inspired by [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/), a Jekyll themed template created in order to help scientists and academics build their own websites.

The easy way would be to fork/import the [foss-reference-hub website](https://cyverse-learning-materials.github.io/foss-reference-hub/) ([repository](https://github.com/CyVerse-learning-materials/foss-reference-hub)) and modify it to reflect your requirements; this tutorial will cover the necessary files and repository structure you require in order to build a successful personal website.

!!! info "Repository Explanation"

    A GitHub hosted website running the [MkDocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) theme requires the following files in order to function:

    - A `docs` folder:
        - A folder that contains all the documents necessary to populate the website's pages.
        - **All of the documents that the user needs to change are in here**.
    - A `mkdocs.yml` file:
        - A `yml` file which contains critical information on the website structure, including themes, fonts, and extensions.
    - A `requirements.txt` file:
        - A file with a list of software necessary to build the website, primilily used by GitHub Actions.
    - A `.github/workflow` folder:
        - Contains the `ghpages.yml` file that controls the GitHub Action.

    The structure of the basic repository is the following:

    ```
    .
    ├── README.md
    ├── mkdocs.yml              <- Governing file for website building
    ├── requirements.txt        <- Requirements file for pip installation (required by website)      
    ├── docs                           
    │   ├── assets              <- Folder for images and additional graphic assets
    │   └── index.md            <- Main website home page
    └── .github
        └── workflows
            └── ghpages.yml     <- GitHub Actions controlling file
    ```
    
    Upon pushing changes, a `gh-pages` branch will be automatically created by the GitHub Action; it is where the website is rendered from.


### Directions A: forking or importing an existing repo

!!! warning "Prerequisites"
    You will require the following in case you want to add code locally.
    
    ??? Info "Create a GitHub account"
        Navigate to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/) and click *Sign Up*, and follow the on screen instructions.

    Additionally, you can choose between Generating a Personal Access Token or using SSH keys. This is useful if you want to work locally and push your changes to GitHub. We are going to cover this further in next week's lesson on [Version Control](05_version_control.md).

    ??? Info "Choice A: Generate a Personal Access Token"
        You can follow the official documentation on how to generate Tokens [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens). We  discussed how to generate tokens in [Week 0](https://foss.cyverse.org/00_basics/#adding-code-locally). Here's are quick steps you can follow in order to setup your account on your machine using tokens:
        
        1. On your coumputer:
            1. Clone your repository (`git clone <repository>`)
            2. Make changes where necessary, and **add** (`git add <changed files>`), **commit** (`git commit -m "<message on changes>"`) and **push** your changes (`git push origin`).
            3. You should be prompted to logging in your GitHub account. Put your email **but not your password**. Instead, open your web browser and follow the steps below:
        2. On GitHub:
            1. Navigate to your GitHub Settings (You can access your account Settings from the drop down menu where your account icon is, on the top right of the screen)
            2. Scroll to the bottom of the left hand side menu to find *Developer settings* and open it.
            3. Click *Personal access tokens* > *Tokens (classic)*
            4. Click *Generate new token* > *Generate new token (classic)*. You might need to input your Authentification code if you have enabled 2FA.
            5. Give it a name, and all the scopes you require (tip: select all scopes and *No Expiration*), then click *Generate Token*. **Copy the new generated Token**
        3. Back on your computer:
            1. If you have been following the steps above, you should still be in your shell with GitHub still asking for your password.
            2. **Paste** your Token here, and you should be logging in. Your changes should then be saved to GitHub.
        
    ??? Info "Choice B: Connecting via SSH"
        The process of connecting your computer to GitHub using an SSH key is more expedited (and probably less confusing). 
        
        As a setup step, see if your computer is already connected to GitHub by doing `ssh -T git@github.com`. If the response message is `git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).` it signifies that your computer is not yet linked with GitHub. To link your computer to github to the following:

        1. Generate an SSH key with a level of encryption that you prefer: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <your github email>`. This command generates an SSH key with [ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) encryption (harder to crack!) and adds your email as "comment" (`-C`, will help recongizing the user adding the key). A number of additional questions are going to ask you where you'd like to save the key and whether you'd like to add a password for protection; unless you want to save it elsewhere, feel free to use the default options. Upon completion you should see something like this:
        ```
        Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/<user>/.ssh/id_ed25519
        Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/<user>/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        The key fingerprint is:
        SHA256:SMSPIStNyA00KPxuYu94KpZgRAYjgt9g4BA4kFy3g1o <your github email>
        The key's randomart image is:
        +--[ED25519 256]--+
        |^B== o.          |
        |%*=.*.+          |
        |+=.E =.+         |
        | .=.+.o..        |
        |....  . S        |
        |.+ o             |
        |+ =              |
        |.o.o             |
        |oo+.             |
        +----[SHA256]-----+
        ``` 
        2. Upon generating the ssh key, copy it. You can reveal it by doing `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.
        3. In GitHub, go to your settings: click your account icon on top right, and from the drop down menu, select *Settings* and then *SSH and GPG keys*. Here, click on *New SSH Key*, where you can then paste the newly geneated key. Add a name reflecting your machine and save changes. 
        
        Optional: if you want to check if you successfully linked your computer to GitHub, do `ssh -t git@github.com`. You should receive the following message: `Hi <GitHub username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
        
1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) or [import](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer) the [FOSS Reference Hub website tutorial repository branch](https://github.com/CyVerse-learning-materials/foss-reference-hub/tree/week-4-pre)
    - Forking or importing will allow you to have your own copy of a specific repository; Cloning a repository **without** forking/importing it first, will lead to the changes being applied to the original repository and not your own copy. You should clone your forked or imported repository, not the original!
2. Navigate to *Settings* > *Actions* > *General*:
    - Under *Action Permissions* select *Allow all actions and reusalbe workflows*
    - Under *Workflow permissions* select *Read and write permissions* and *Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests*
3. Edit the `mkdocs.yml` and push your changes
    - The first changes you should be making are in the first few lines in the `mkdocs.yml` file in order to reflect your necessities:
        -   Line 1: `site_name:` change to any title you want for your website 
        -   Line 2: `site_description:` give a short description of the website
        -   Line 3: `site_author: ` who you are
        -   Line 4: `site_url:` change it to the URL reflected in *Settings*, which will most likely be `https://<github-username.github.io>/`
        -   Line 7: `repo_name: ` give the name of your repository (e.g., `academicpages-mkdocs` in this case)
        -   Line 8: `repo_url:` give the git repository URL 
        -   Line 11: `copyright:` change `your name` to the maintainer of the website (likely to be you)
    !!! warning "Workflow expectations"
        The previos changes *should* trigger the GitHub action workflow, which is setup to apply changes to the website every time a commit is pushed. One of the first thing that `mkdocs-material` will do, is to create the `gh-pages` branch (in case you do not have it already). **The workflow will fail because the `ghpages.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory is disabled (["commented out"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comment_out))**. To enable it, remove the `#` at the beginnig on each line and commit your changes. Upon changes, the workflow should go ahead and create the `gh-pages` branch.
4. Navigate to *Settings* > *Pages* and make sure that *Source* is *Deploy from a branch* and Branch is *gh-pages*, */(root)*
    - You should be able to access your website at `https://<github-username>.github.io/`. If you cannot find your website, go to the repository's settings page and navigate to *Pages*: your website address will be there.
5. Edit documents as necessary.
    - Don't forget to **add**, **commit** and **push** changes!
    - Changes will only be visible on the website after a successful push.
    - After each push, next to the commit identifier GitHub will show either a yellow circle (:yellow_circle:, meaning building), green check (:material-check:, meaning success), or red cross (:x:, meaning failure).
    ??? Tip "Failure? Try again!"
        If you've been given the red cross :x:, GitHub will notify you with what went wrong. By clicking on the :x:, GitHub will open up a new page showing you the broken process.

### Directions B: Creating your own

!!! warning "Prerequisites"

        2. Upon generating the ssh key, copy it. You can reveal it by doing `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.
        3. In GitHub, go to your settings: click your account icon on top right, and from the drop down menu, select *Settings* and then *SSH and GPG keys*. Here, click on *New SSH Key*, where you can then paste the newly geneated key. Add a name reflecting your machine and save changes. 
        
        Optional: if you want to check if you successfully linked your computer to GitHub, do `ssh -t git@github.com`. You should receive the following message: `Hi <GitHub username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

1. Create your own repository
    - Add a README and a license and keep the repository public
2. Create a `docs` folder
    - Within the folder, create an `index.md` file
3. Navigate to *Settings* > *Actions* > *General*:
    - Under *Action Permissions* select *Allow all actions and reusalbe workflows*
    - Under *Workflow permissions* select *Read and write permissions* and *Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests*
4. Create an `requirements.txt` file and populate it with the following requirement list:

6. Create a `.github/workflows` folder and add a `ghpages.yml` with the following:

    ??? abstract "Expand for code!"      
        ```
        name: Publish docs via GitHub
        on:
        push:
            branches:
            - main

        jobs:
        build:
            name: Deploy docs
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
                with:
                    python-version: 3.9
            - name: run requirements file
                run:  pip install -r requirements.txt 
            - name: Deploy docs
                run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
                env:
                    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        ```

7. Navigate to *Settings* > *Pages* and make sure that *Source* is *Deploy from a branch* and Branch is *gh-pages*, */(root)*
    - You should be able to access your website at `https://<github-username>.github.io/`. If you cannot find your website, go to the repository's settings page and navigate to *Pages*: your website address will be there.
8. Edit documents as necessary.
    - Don't forget to **add**, **commit** and **push** changes!
    - Changes will only be visible on the website after a successful push.
    - After each push, next to the commit identifier GitHub will show either a yellow circle (:yellow_circle:, meaning building), green check (:material-check:, meaning success), or red cross (:x:, meaning failure).

## Self Assessment

??? Question "True or False: Tutorials and How-to-Guides are the same"

    !!! Success "False"

        Tutorials are in general introductory and longer than How-to-Guides and are intended for teaching learners a new concept by describing applications and providing justifications. 

        How-to-Guides are more like cooking recipes which include step-by-step instructions for a specific task.

??? Question "True or False: Teams should communicate over a single messaging platform."

    !!! Success "False"

        While it may be advisable to push informal communication toward a platform like SLACK or Microsoft Teams, there is no one-platform-fits-all solution for managing a diverse science team.

??? Question "What is the best communication platform for team science?"

    !!! Info "There is no best platform, but there are some best practices"

        In general, communications amongst team members may be best suited for messaging services like SLACK, Teams, or Chat.

        For software development, GitHub Issues are one of the primary means of documenting changes and interactions on the web.

        Formal communication over email is preferred, and is necessary for legal, budgetary, and institutional interactions.
