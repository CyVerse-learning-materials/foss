# GitHub Pages - quick start

This is a quick introduction to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a simple way to use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to set up a small website written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). This page won't do everything, but you can throw
up a basic website, use [themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/), and extend it.

1.  Go to https://github.com/. Login, or if you don't have an account get one and login.
2.  Go to the "+" icon on the upper right and select **New repository**.
3.  Enter a name for your repository (e.g. "profile"). Enter a description, and leave the repository as public. Select "**Initialize this repository with a README**". If desired select a license. Finally click **Create repository**.
4.  Look for the **Settings** menu (upper right, next to a "gear" icon). Scroll down to **GitHub Pages** and choose **master** branch and save your selection. Then Choose a theme and select your theme. You will be asked to **Commit changes**.
5.  Your website will be visible at `https://GITHUBUSERNAME.github.io/REPONAME/`. (be sure to change *GITHUBUSERNAME* to your username, and *REPONAME* to the name you selected for your repo.)
6.  You can edit your website by editing the readme file as desired.

!!! Tip
        You can preview how your [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) looks using and editor like [Markdown Plus](https://mdp.tylingsoft.com/).
