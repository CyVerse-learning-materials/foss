**Research Cyberinfrastructure associated with CyVerse**
==========================

While CyVerse provides free and open resources for data storage and computing, you may find that your work is pushing the limits of what CyVerse offers in its core services.

By design, there are other national research organizations whom you should be aware of, and ready to interface with. CyVerse is a partner with numerous other organizations, and can be used as a nexus to send your data and algorithms to the largest public research computing centers in the world. 

**XSEDE**
--------

The `eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) <https://www.xsede.org/>`_ is a single virtual system that scientists can use to interactively share computing resources, data and expertise. People around the world use these resources and services â€” things like supercomputers, collections of data and new tools.

**Exercise** 

1. Sign up for an XSEDE account via the `User Portal <https://portal.xsede.org/>`_

2. Determine whether you're ready for a start up allocation on one of the XSEDE resource.

3. Fill out an XSEDE startup allocation.

**Jetstream**
~~~~~~~~

Jetstream is CyVerse Atmosphere deployed on XSEDE. Allocations can be requested using the XSEDE portal. 

With Jetstream, you can launch larger VMs than on CyVerse (currently up to 44-cores) with an option for GPU computing in the near future.

**TACC**
~~~~~

CyVerse resources are mirrored between the University of Arizona and the `Texas Advanced Computing Center(TACC) <https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/>`_. You can access TACC resources from CyVerse, or log directly into their infrastructure via XSEDE.

**Open Science Grid**
~~~~~~~

The `OpenScienceGrid (OSG) <https://opensciencegrid.org/>`_ is another CyVerse partner. You can use the OSG through our Discovery Environmetn to launch high throughput computing jobs. 

**CyVerse Powered By**
------------

CyVerse supports "`Powered by <http://www.cyverse.org/powered-by-cyverse>`_" projects which utilize more of the available CyVerse cyberinfrastructure than are exposed through its public services.
