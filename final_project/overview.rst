Final Project Overview
------------------------------

The final project for FOSS is designed to give you the opportunity to apply some of the skills and ideas from the rest of the course to one of your own projects, get support and feedback from your peers, and share your experiences with the rest of the attendees. 

Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- "Level up" the openness of an existing or planned project
- Apply a skill or concept from FOSS
- Discuss your applied skills/concepts with groupmates
- Determine possible next steps to "level up" your project
- Share your experiences with the rest of the attendees

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the FOSS final project, you will choose one skill or concept from FOSS and apply it to one of your own projects. The level we're looking for is a topic that spans half of a meeting to a full meeting. For instance, you could write a Data Management Plan for an upcoming project proposal, or you could reorganize an existing project and put all the code onto GitHub. You should try to identify what "level" your project is currently at for a given topic, and attempt to move up a level. This means you can try out a skill or idea you've never used before, or go to a more advanced level for something you already do.

You can get started on this part of the project **at any time**! The earlier you start, the more you'll be able to accomplish. If the topic you'd like to cover is only taught later on in the course, and you're feeling extra ambitious, you can get a headstart if you want.

You should have your skill/topic chosen by **Week 8**, and you will then enter your name / topic into [this spreadsheet](). We'll use this to put together small groups.

During Week 9, you will meet with your group to a) discuss your experiences applying your skill or concept, b) give each other help with sticking points you may have encountered, and c) put together a short (5-10 minute) presentation to be given to the rest of the groups during Week 10. The presentation can be based off of [this discussion guide](), and should focus on the challenges and tips you may have for other FOSS attendees who want to utilize your skill or concept in the future.

Timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Week 8: finalize topic choice and enter into [spreadsheet]()
- Between Week 8 and Week 9 meetings: work on your project
- Week 9: group discussions and presentation prep
- Week 10: group presentations
