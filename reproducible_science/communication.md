# **Communication**

We will cover both internal and external communication strategies during
the workshop.

## **Internal**

Choosing which software to use for your internal lab communication can
be complicated by the cost of setting up, the cost of maintaining, and
simply by the sheer number of platforms that are out there.

For this workshop, we use [SLACK](https://slack.com/) (Searchable Log of
All Conversation & Knowledge). Microsoft\'s competitor to SLACK is
[Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/start).

Remember, the intention of these platforms are to **improve
productivity** & not become a distraction.

::: remember
**SLACK**

-   Slack has [plenty of apps](https://slack.com/apps) for coordinating
    multiple services, i.e. Calendars, Github, GoogleDrive, Box, etc.
-   Slack is limiting unless you\'re willing to pay for the professional
    support.

**Microsoft Teams**

-   Teams is used by many R1 research universities as part of their
    campus wide license agreement for Office 365 Business and Education.

**Gitter**

-   Native integration with Github or Gitlab
-   Uses your GitHub username or Twitter handle for all Gitters you\'re
    a part of

**External** \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

Although we didn\'t cover it explicitly in the announcement for the
workshop, communicating with the public and other members of your
science community is one of the most important parts of your science!

There are many ways scientists use social media and the web to share
their data science ideas:

1.  [\"Science
    Twitter\"](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/08/scientists-do-you-want-succeed-twitter-here-s-how-many-followers-you-need) -
    is really just regular
    [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/science?lang=en), but with a
    focus on following other scientists and organizations, and tweeting
    about research you\'re interested in. By building up a significant
    following, more people will know you, know about your work, and
    you\'ll have a higher likelihood of meeting other new collaborators.
2.  [Blogs](https://blogging.org/blog/top-science-blogs/) - there are
    numerous platforms for blogging about research, the older platforms
    tend to dominate this space. Other platforms like,
    [Medium](https://medium.com/topic/data-science) offer a place for
    reseachers to create personalized reading spaces and self publish.
3.  Community groups - There are lists (and lists of lists) of
    [nationals research
    organizations](https://www.google.com/search?q=list+of+professional+science+organizations),
    in which a researcher can become involved. These older organziations
    still rely on official websites, science journal blogs, and email
    lists to communicate with their members. In the earth sciences there
    are open groups which focus on communication like the [Earth Science
    Information Partners (ESIP)](https://www.esipfed.org/) with
    progressive ideas about how data and science can be done. Other
    groups, like [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and
    [Research Bazaar](https://resbazblog.wordpress.com/about/) are
    focused on data science training and digital literacy.

**Remember** Personal and Professional Accounts are Not Isolated

You decide what you post on the internet. Your scientist identity may be
a part of your personal identity on social media, it might be separate.
A future employer or current employer can see your old posts. What you
post in your personal accounts can be considered a reflection of the
organization you work for and may be used in decisions about hiring or
dismissal.
