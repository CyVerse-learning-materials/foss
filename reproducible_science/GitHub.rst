**GitHub**
===================

`Version Control <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control>`_ is an important component in software development which manages changes to documents, websites, code, or other digital information. Version control can save you when code changes break things. Web hosting of your code repositories lets you share and work on code together and save your work in the event of a hardware failure. 

The `most commmon version control software <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software>`_ in data science are ``git``, ``svn``, ``cvs``, and ``bzr``.

Given the limited amount of time we have this week, we are only going to cover `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ and one web-based hosting service (`GitHub <https://github.com/>`_) in this camp.

In this lesson you will learn how to:

- Interact with ``git`` via GitHub
	- Using a browser
  	- Using the command line
- Add collaborators to your organization
- Initialize a ``git`` repository on the command line and push it to GitHub
	- Push/pull files
	- Commit to GitHub
- Learn about versions
	- Forks
	- Branches
	- Merges
	- Revert
	- Releases
	- Badging

.. Goals::

	- Feel comfortable using the GitHub environment
	- Integrate at least one repository onto GitHub


.. Prerequisites::
	
   In order to complete this exercise you should have already installed ``git`` for the command line (`instructions <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_) & created an account on the `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_

.. Important::

   GitHub is not really intended for storing or manipulating data

**Navigating & Interacting with GitHub**
------------------------------------------

Basic Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~

|Git_Hub|

The basic layout includes:

- Profile
- Organizations
- Teams
- Repositories
- `Projects <https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards>`_
- Followers
- Contributions
- Watch / Unwatch repos

**Add a Collaborator**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Online only*

1. Go to your Organization
2. Click "people"
3. Invite someone!

OR

1. Can add collaborators under "Settings" -> "Collaborators"

**Create a Repo Online & Locally**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Online*

1. Go to your dasboard
2. Click "New"
3. Name the repository
4. Initialize with "README"
   - form of metadata
   - this tells you and the those looking at the repository what it is about
5. Go to "Clone or Download" and clone to local folder / directory titled "Lab"
6. Can delete repo under "Settings" -> "Options"

**Command Line**

1. Locate or create a local folder / directory structure titled "Lab"

.. code-block:: bash

   cd
   mkdir -p github/lab
   cd github/lab
   

2. Initialize folder as a repository with ``git``

.. code-block:: bash

   git init
   echo "This is a test repo" >> README.md #append to file
   git add . #add all the files in the current directory
   git commit -m "initial project"

.. NOTE::

   **Documentation is vital** *You will be doing this for YOU 6 months from now*

**Interact with GitHub**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Clone a repo**

This is used to work *locally* rather than online.

*Online*

1. Click the down arrow "Clone or download"
2. Click "Open in Desktop"
3. Select where to save it
   - Create a folder for GitHub repos on your computer locally

*Command Line*

.. code-block:: bash

   cd path/to/location
   git clone <url> [rename]
   #URL of thte repository on GitHub
   #rename the directory (optional)

**Commit**

*Online*

1. Create a file  by clicking "Create a new file"
2. Name file (/name)
3. Write commit message
4. Press "Commit"

OR

1. Create a file *locally*
2. Click "Upload files"
3. Select file(s) within a folder

*Command Line*

1. Create a file

.. code-block:: bash

   cd path/to/repo
   touch file.txt

2. Add file(s)

.. code-block:: bash

   git add -A #adds all the new files
   git push
   git commit -m "added file" #-m initiates a message


.. tip::

    It is good practice to write commmit messages to remember what you added or fixed.

**Create an Issue**

Issues are great for tracking decisions made or to-do lists

*Online only*

1. Click on the repository you just created.
2. Click on "Issues"
3. Click on "New issue"
4. Create a title (# and issue number for reference)
5. Assign to someone, or create a label
6. Submit new issue
7. Close issue

.. Exercise::

   Create a new issue and relate it back to the issue you just created.


**Version Control**

*Online*

1. Click on file
2. Click "History"

*Command Line*

.. code-block:: bash

   git log
   git log --stat #gives abbreviated stats for each commit
   git log --pretty=oneline #can also add options: short, full, fuller
   git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s #lots of options for pretty=format
   q #to quit

**Create a branch**

Branches are useful to working on code etc. without disturbing the *master branch*.

*Online*

1. Select the down arrow on the repository page that says "Branch:master"
2. Create a new branch name

OR

1. Add new file or edit existing file.
2. Write a commit message.
3. Select "Create a **new branch**"

*Command Line*

1. Create a new branch

.. code-block:: bash

   cd path/to/repo
   #common practice to pull before commiting anything
   git pull #does a fetch for you 
   git checkout -b new-branch #creates a new branch and puts you on that branch
   #set new branch upstream
   git push --set-upstream origin new-branch

2. Edit some files

.. code-block:: bash

   #edit files
   vi path/to/file
   q #to quit

3. Commit changes

.. code-block:: bash

   git pull
   git add 
   commit -am "changed a file" #stage changes and write a message
   git push


**Make a pull request**

Pull requests are useful to have another set of eyes to review changes  before merging them with the master branch.

*Online Only*

1. From your branch, create a new file
2. Commit file to your branch
3. Hit "Compare & pull request"
4. Go to pull requests
5. Set it on the master branch

**Merge**

*Online*

1. Go to "Pull requests"
2. Select down arrow of "Merge pull request" (if no conflicts)
3. Delete branch
4. Leave comment if need be
5. Close pull request

*Command Line*

.. code-block:: bash

   cd path/to/repo
   git pull
   git checkout new-branch
   git merge master #testing to see if merging breaks anythin
   git checkout master
   git merge new-branch #now repull it all into master

**Revert**

*Command Line*

.. code-block:: bash

   git log
   #copy tag for last working commit
   git revert <tag to last working commit>
   #will make it look like a new commit
   git add -A
   git commit -m "changed things back to <commit tag>"
   git push

**Advanced**
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Fork**

*Online*

1. Go to a new repository
2. Click fork
3. Save to personal repository.
4. Clone to Desktop.
5. Interact via online or in Desktop.
6. If want to make suggestions, can create a pull request.

*Command Line*

.. code-block:: bash

   git close <github-repo>
   cd <new-folder>
   git fork

**Etc.**
~~~~~~~~
These are *Online only*

.. Definitions::

   **Git** - tool for version control.
   
   **GitHub** - hosted server that is also interactive.
   
   **repo** - short for repository; GitHub lets you create a remote repository online.
   
   **local** - on your personal computer.
   
   **clone** - copy of a repository that lives locally on your computer. Pushing changes will affect the repository online.
