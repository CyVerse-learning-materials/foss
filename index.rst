CyVerse Learning Institute - Foundations of Open Science Skills (FOSS) 2020
------------------------------------

Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS) is a novel, camp-style training designed to prepare principal investigators and their lab teams, both new and established, to meet the growing expectations of funding agencies, publishers, and research institutions for scientific reproducibility and data accessibility.

**Workshop Level**

There are no pre-requisites for FOSS, but the course will cover a lot of material in a short time. Participants who have limited computational experience should try to view the `Software Carpentry Core Lessons <https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/>`_ before attending.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

- Become familiar with productivity software for organizing your lab group, communications, and research
- Learn how to scale out your computation from laptop to cloud and high performance computing (HPC) systems
- Learn how to manage data for open science and reproducibility


By working through an example project relevant to their interests, participants will practice open science skills using CyVerse, GitHub, R or Python, and other resources. At the end of the week, students will present a plan for how to integrate open science into their labs.
