Welcome to Foundational Open Science Skills!
-----------------------

Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS) is a novel, camp-style training designed to prepare principal investigators and their lab teams, both new and established, to meet the growing expectations of funding agencies, publishers, and research institutions for scientific reproducibility and data accessibility.

-----

Expected outcomes:
------------------

- Proficiently organize your lab, communications, and research with productivity software
- Capably scale out your computation from laptop to cloud and HPC systems
- Skillfully manage the data lifecycle for open science and reproducibility
- Connect with colleagues across institutional boundaries and research domains
- Engage with the community of Open Science practitioners

By working through an example project relevant to your interests, you will practice open science skills using CyVerse, GitHub, R or Python, and other resources. At the end of the course, you and your team will present a plan for how to integrate open science into your research, lab, or other areas of your choosing.
