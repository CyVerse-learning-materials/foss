**Code of Conduct**
============================

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at FOSS Camp are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe, inclusive, and collaborative environment for everybody.

Harassment by any individual will not be tolerated and may result in the individual being removed from the Camp.

Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Workshop staff are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, staff should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material that conflicts with the code of conduct.

Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the workshop organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop with no refund.

If you are being harassed, or notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the workshop staff immediately. Workshop staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the workshop. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
