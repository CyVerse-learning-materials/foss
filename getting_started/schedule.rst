        #. Data Stewardship Wizard
        #. HW: Review videos
        #. HW: Start forming a team
      - Inspirational talk on data science. Launch into the course by discussing shared challenges for working with data.
      - Understand how your research and associated data challenges fit into the context of this course. Use a tool to help develop a data management strategy.
    * - **Week 3**, Feb. 23 & 24, *Essential Linux Skills*
      - Activities & HW:
        #. Intro to VICE
        #. Intro to Linux skills
      - Working in teams, beginner command line users will get introduced to basic tools and lessons for learning more. Advanced learners will help as TAs. We’ll learn just enough to make sense of the parts of this course that will use command line tools.
      - Beginning learners will gain basic understanding of the command line (survival skills). Advanced learners will reinforce teaching skills. Learners will be able to use the VICE platform to launch a command-line interface.
    * - **Week 4**, Mar. 2 & 3, *Planning Your Open Science Lab*
      - Activities & HW:
        #. Reproducibility Crisis
        #. Tools for documenting and sharing (Markdown, text editing, communication tools, social media)
        #. Introducing Github
      - We will discuss the major challenges of doing reproducible science. We’ll cover some of the basic tools for organizing within your lab and community. We will also introduce Github as key platform for organizing and disseminating - including but not limited to open source software
      - Know some of the basic tools for documenting and sharing your work in an open source way. Understand how to use some basic features of GitHub (without needing to program)
    * - **Week 5**, Mar. 9 & 10, *Using Git Without Knowing Git*
      - Activities & HW:
        #. Capstone I - Building a GitHub Page

        #. HW: Find a software tool you’d like to be able to install and use on your own
      - To apply what we have learned so far, each team will build a shared GitHub page to introduce their FOSS team, and the work of the team members
      - Be able to use authoring tools and Github to develop a simple website that documents and shares their work.
    * - **Break** Mar. 16 & 17
      -

      - Activities & HW:
        #. Capstone II: Applying what you have learned
      - Each FOSS team will work on a self-directed project to apply what they have learned into a small shared challenge that applies the skills covered so far.
      - Be able to collaborate as a team to deliver a product that makes use of the skills covered in this workshop and relates to their own research objectives
