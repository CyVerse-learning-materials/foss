**SERVICES**

HSIB is adjacent the Banner University Medical Center. In the event of a medical emergency, attendees may be transported to Banner, or to the nearest `urgent care <https://goo.gl/maps/ZkLMyDcDQPQEAAia9>`_ facility.

Lactation rooms are available in HSIB 406 and in BSRL on 2nd floor -- ask Tina if you need help locating them.
