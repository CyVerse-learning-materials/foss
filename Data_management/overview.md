# **Data Management Overview**

::: admonition
learning-objectives

-   Recognize data as the foundation of open science and be able to
    describe the \"life cycle of data\"
-   Use self-assessments to evaluate your current data management
    practices
-   Cite tools and resources to improve your data management practices
-   Know the biggest challenge to effective data management
:::

## Why should you care about data management?

Data is the raw currency of open science. Most work centers on creating
data or adding to its value. The goal of this section is to highlight
how you can make your data more valuable by managing it more effectively
and with less effort.

> ::: admonition
> How would you answer?
>
> If you give your data to a colleague who has not been involved with
> your project, would they be able to make sense of it? Would they be
> able to use it properly?
>
> If you come back to your own data in five years, will you be able to
> make sense of it? Will you be able to use it properly?
>
> When you are ready to publish a paper, is it easy to find all the
> correct versions of all the data you used and present them in a
> comprehensible manner?
> :::

Data management skills produce self-describing datasets that:

> -   Make life much easier for you and your collaborators
> -   Benefit the scientific research community by allowing others to
>     reuse your data
> -   Are required by most funders and many journals
>     -   Recent from NSF
>     -   NSF

## Data Self-assessment

## Data Types

Different types of data require different management practices. What are
some data types and sources you might use in your work? (Adapted from
DMP Tool )

**Data Types**

> -   Text: field or laboratory notes, survey responses
> -   Numeric: tables, counts, measurements
> -   Audiovisual: images, sound recordings, video
> -   Models, computer code
> -   Discipline-specific: FASTA in biology, FITS in astronomy, CIF in
>     chemistry
> -   Instrument-specific: equipment outputs

**Data Sources**

*Observational*

> -   Captured in real-time, typically outside the lab
> -   Usually irreplaceable and therefore the most important to
>     safeguard
> -   Examples: Sensor readings, telemetry, survey results, images

*Experimental*

> -   Typically generated in the lab or under controlled conditions
> -   Often reproducible, but can be expensive or time-consuming
> -   Examples: gene sequences, chromatograms, magnetic field readings

*Simulation*

> -   Machine generated from test models
> -   Likely to be reproducible if the model and inputs are preserved
> -   Examples: climate models, economic models

*Derived / Compiled*

> -   Generated from existing datasets
> -   Reproducible, but can be very expensive and time-consuming
> -   Examples: text and data mining, compiled database, 3D models

**Part II: Data-specific questions**

Here are some questions about how you manage and work with data. We will
complete some more formal assessments later, but for now let\'s see
where you are.

> ::: admonition
> Question
>
> In small groups, discuss the following questions. You will be provided

> 2.  Do you follow specific recommendations for managing the data you
>     work with? If not, do you know if guidelines exist?
> :::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Best practices for the data life cycle

**The most important thing to remember about data management is that you
are not alone.** There are data management experts within your
discipline, many of them not farther away than your university library
system. In addition, there are many organizations (including many cited
below) which work to solve.

Here are some excellent steps to consider. The summary below is adapted
from the excellent .

**Plan**

> -   Describe the data that will be compiled, and how the data will be
>     managed and made accessible throughout its lifetime
> -   A good plan considers each of the stages below

**Collect**

> -   Have a plan for data organization in place before collecting data
> -   Collect and store observation metadata at the same time you
>     collect the metadata
> -   Take advantage of machine generated metadata

**Assure**

> -   Record any conditions during collection that might affect the
>     quality of the data
> -   Distinguish estimated values from measured values
> -   Double check any data entered by hand
> -   Perform statistical and graphical summaries (e.g., max/min,
>     average, range) to check for questionable or impossible values.
> -   Mark data quality, outliers, missing values, etc.

**Describe:**

> -   Comprehensive data documentation (i.e. metadata) is the key to
>     future understanding of data. Without a thorough description of
>     the context of the data, the context in which they were collected,
>     the measurements that were made, and the quality of the data, it
>     is unlikely that the data can be easily discovered, understood, or
>     effectively used.
>
> -   Organize your data for publication. Before you can describe your
>     data, you must decide how to organize them. This should be planned
>     before hand, so that data organization is a minimal task at the
>     time of publication.
>
> -   Thoroughly describe the dataset (e.g., name of dataset, list of
>     files, date(s) created or modified, related datasets) including
>     the people and organizations involved in data collection (e.g.,
>     authors, affiliations, sponsor). Also include:
>
>     > -   An (obtain one if you don\'t have one).
>     > -   The scientific context (reason for collecting the data, how
>     >     they were collected, equipment and software used to generate
>     >     the data, conditions during data collection, spatial and
>     >     temporal resolution)
>     > -   The data themselves
>     >     -   How each measurement was produced
>     >     -   Units
>     >     -   Format
>     >     -   Quality assurance activities
>     >     -   Precision, accuracy, and uncertainty

Metadata standards and ontologies are invaluable for supporting data
reuse. Metadata standards tell you:

> -   Which metadata attributes to include
> -   How to format your metadata
> -   What values are allowable for different attributes

Some metadata standards you may want to consider:

> -   for publishing data
> -   for sharing data on the web
> -   Minimum Information for any (x) sequence
> -   for geospatial data

Ontologies provide standardization for metadata values:

> -   Example: terms for the MIxS standards
> -   Example: for plant tissue types or development stages
> -   lists standards and ontologies for life sciences.

The CyVerse Data Commons supports good data description through:

> -   Metadata templates
> -   Bulk metadata upload
> -   Automatic collection of analysis parameters, inputs, and outputs
>     in the DE.

**Preserve**

In general, data must be preserved in an appropriate long-term archive
(i.e. data center). Here are some examples:

> -   Sequence data should go to a national repository, frequently
> -   Identify data with value \-- it may not be necessary to preserve
>     all data from a project
> -   The CyVerse provides a place to publish and preserve data that was
>     generated on or can be used in CyVerse, where no other repository
>     exists.
> -   See lists of repositories at
> -   See lists of repositories at
> -   Github repos can get DOIs through
> -   Be aware of licensing and other intellectual property issues
>     -   Repositories will require some kind of license, often the
>         least restrictive (see for example
>     -   Repositories are unlikely to enforce reuse restrictions, even
>         if you apply them.

**Discover**

> -   Good metadata allows you to discover your own data!
> -   Databases, repositories, and search indices provide ways to
>     discover relevant data for reuse - - -

**Integrate**

> -   Data integration is a lot of work
> -   Standards and ontologies are key to future data integration
> -   Know the data before you integrate them
> -   Don\'t trust that two columns with the same header are the same
>     data
> -   Properly cite the data you reuse!
> -   Use DOIs () wherever possible

**Analyze**

> -   Follow open science principles for reproducible analyses (CyVerse,
>     RStudio, notebooks, IDEs)
> -   State your hypotheses and analysis workflow before collecting
>     data. Tools like (OSF) allow you to make this public.
> -   Record all software, parameters, inputs, etc.
