**Data Management Plans (DMP)**
----------------------

.. #### Comment: Introduction to basic data management principles

"A data management plan or DMP is a formal document that outlines how data are to be handled both during a research project, and after the project is completed.[1] The goal of a data management plan is to consider the many aspects of data management, metadata generation, data preservation, and analysis before the project begins; this may lead to data being well-managed in the present, and prepared for preservation in the future."

**Why bother?**

**Stick:** `You have to make one <https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19069/nsf19069.jsp>`_

Reviewers definitely look at them, but they may not be enforced.

**Carrot:** Make your life easier
 - Planning for you project makes it run more smoothly
 - Avoid surprise costs

Elements of a good DMP
====================
 - Information about data & data format(s)
       - data types
       - data sources
       - analysis methods
       - formats
       - QA/QC
       - version control
       - **data life cycle**
 - Metadata content and format(s)
       - format
       - standards
 - Policies for access, sharing, and re-use
       - funder obligations
       - ethical and privacy issues (data justice)
       - intellectual property, copyright, citation
       - timeline for releases
 - Long-term storage, data management, and preservation
       - which data to preserve
       - which archive/repository
 - Budget (`PAPPG <https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg19_1/pappg_2.jsp#IIC2gvib>`_)
       - each of the above elements cost time/money
       - Personnel time for data preparation, management, documentation, and preservation (including time)
       - Hardware and/or software for data management, back up, security, documentation, and preservation (including time)
       - Publication/archiving costs (including time)
 
Not only what, but *who* (roles).

Extra challenges for collaborative projects.

Machine actionable DMPs
=======================

 - DMPs describe research methods that will evolve over the course of a project
 - to be a useful tool for researchers and others, the content must be updated to capture the methods that are employed and the data that are produced
