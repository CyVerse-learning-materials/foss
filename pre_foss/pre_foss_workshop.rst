[Area_1] Topic1
----------------------------------
.. #### Comment: A major functionality is a heading for one or more functions
   grouped together from the point of view of the user. If you were writing a
   book (manual?) on the platform, these would be the headings.

   The first major recommended functionality are user settings and preferences
   Next are any important groupings, and these may correspond to major buttons
   on a dashboard or user interface.
