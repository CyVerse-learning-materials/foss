Introduction to Open Science
------------------------------
        
What is Open Science?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Workshop Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each week we will discuss a new topic, ranging from data management to documentation to software management. Much of the content will intersect and cross over from week to week, and many of the skills and approaches we discuss will interact with each other. As you already know, being a scientist requires you to wear many hats, and trying to do Open Science is no different.

As we mentioned, Open Science is not a set of boxes you need to check off to be "Certified Open", but an intersecting set of philosophies and approaches, all of which occur on some type of spectrum. Our ultimate goal in this workshop is for you to "level up" one or more of those philosophies/approaches/skills. For example, if your project currently has no documentation, you could level up to including a thorough README file laying out your project's structure. If you already have minimal documentation, maybe you level up to a GitHub pages website with some worked examples and guides.
